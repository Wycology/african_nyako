1:40
potato heap so basically these are the
1:42
leaves so the sweet potato it's a root
1:45
tuber so it's down down down down
1:49
this is how you get it
1:57
so this is a sweet potato
1:59
i've just got it you see it's fresh from
2:02
the soil
2:03
yeah
2:06
and then you have to cover it back
2:08
because
2:10
they are still growing and you look for
2:12
some
2:13
thing else
2:16
for another one just around

2:26
so this one is small i will not take it
2:28
i'll leave it to grow just cover it
2:31
and then look for bigger one
2:34
if you don't find a big gun the same hip
2:36
you go to another hip
