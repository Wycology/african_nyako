0:59
you waiting for subscribe because
1:01
there's more a lot to come
1:03
subscribe subscribe subscribe and hit
1:06
the like button anyway so we we went to
1:08
the morning and got the fish from the
1:10
river but i didn't
1:12
report
1:14
so we can basically start from here
1:18
we can start from here so you get your
1:19
fish from the river or you buy fresh
1:22
fish so this is fresh from that
1:24
river
1:28
yeah
1:29
so when you get your fish you have to
1:31
sand right for like one and a half hour
1:36
and then get your charcoal light your
1:39
charcoal as you can see down there there
1:41
is charcoal and it's lit it's on fire
1:43
and bring a wire mesh
1:45
like you press the wire mesh on
1:49
the fire
1:51
and then you start putting your
1:53
fish there
1:54
after smoking it a bit
1:57
then put it in the smoking tunnel should
2:00
i call it a ton i don't really know a
2:02
word for it but it's just built with
2:05
bricks so basically down there it's
2:07
where you put the fire and then up on
2:10
top that we put our wire mesh
2:12
and you place your fish on the wire mesh
2:15
as you can see in the video
2:21
[Music]
2:34
[Music]
2:47
so after putting or arranging them on a
2:50
wire mesh and putting the fire down
2:54
in that thing then you cover it with
2:57
some iron sheets as you can see and on
3:00
the top of the iron sheets you put heavy
3:02
stones so that they cannot be blown away
3:05
by the wind
3:06
so basically after doing all that you
3:09
put your firewood
3:11
and you have to use like
3:13
android
3:15
undried
3:23
use and dry firewood
3:25
that
3:26
it just
3:28
be hitting it slowly basically because
3:30
you don't need a lot of fire otherwise
3:32
they'll get
3:33
burnt so that's basically what we are
3:35
doing
3:37
that should be mark
3:40
i almost do now
3:43
no you're good after putting our fish in
3:46
whatever and then you put uh fire
3:48
everything you leave it for three hours
3:51
and you come and check on it so this is
3:53
basically the result it's all smoked
3:56
well
3:57
ready to be preserved for days and days
4:00
without going bad as you can see
4:03
in the video we are turning it so if the
4:06
other part first gets smoked you have to
4:08
turn it
4:10
the other way around i don't know side
4:12
by side yeah you have to first smoke one
4:14
side then you turn the other side also
4:16
to smoke well as you can see now our
4:19
fish is all well preserved and smoked
4:22
well to live for future use like this is
4:26
our food security this is how like we
4:28
can keep food for further use because we
4:30
cannot preserve it in the refrigerator
4:32
because we don't own any
4:34
anyway
4:36
so this is the best way to do it and if
4:38
you cannot smoke your fish you can send
4:40
right i'll make another video showing
4:42
you how you can sun dry your fish and
4:44
preserve it for the longest time
4:46
ever
