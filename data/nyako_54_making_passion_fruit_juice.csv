0:13
so for the starters if you don't know
0:15
passion fruit this is the passion fruit
0:20
in luganda it's called
0:22
in my language it's matuina
0:25
it's matuinda so i don't know the
0:27
difference m and yeah it's m and m so
0:29
it's just a pronunciation but it's
0:31
called
0:31
opportunity
0:33
this is passion for this these are the
0:34
yellow ones so it's
0:36
always green when it's
0:39
young and when it grows it becomes
0:42
bigger and then yellow
0:44
so
0:45
before i go into the video can you
0:47
please subscribe hit the like button and
0:50
press the notification bell
0:52
yeah so basically what you need to make
0:55
this juice you need a sieve so this is
0:57
our thing don't laugh at our sieve but
0:59
that's what we can afford
1:01
yeah
1:03
and this cup
1:04
is for making the juice
1:06
and this and we need some sugar
1:11
and then water
1:13
so i'll be put this is drinking water my
1:15
india
1:16
yeah this is drinking water so
1:20
let's start so step number one what you
1:22
do you get your passion fruit you have
1:26
to wash your fruits anyway
1:28
so you get your passion fruit
1:30
and then you cut it
1:48
so this is inside but if you want you
1:50
can even eat it but for me it's not for
1:52
eating it's for juice
1:57
so and then you put here
2:10
this is how you add your passion fruit
2:12
treats
2:14
in the sieve
2:16
and then you start seasoning it
2:29
ourselves is small so it's basically
2:31
going to take us a long period of time
2:34
to do all these special treats
2:38
because you have a very small sieve
2:48
and then add some
2:53
some of this
2:55
sugar
2:57
sugar
2:59
you have to add sugar
3:03
and then you do this
3:13
so this is the process of making the
3:15
juice
3:20
what's the juice you guys can see
3:35
you have to do like this until you start
3:37
seeing the black seeds as you can see
3:40
inserting the black seed then you know
3:42
you're almost there
3:47
so this is the juice
3:49
that we are making
3:56
so it is uh orange not only passion
3:58
juice from the passion fruit
4:03
then you add some water
4:20
so you guys
4:21
comment below if you also do like this
4:24
if you make your juice like this or you
4:26
have a blender
4:27
firstly we don't have a blender but in
4:29
the future we'll have one
4:32
food wheeling
4:35
but we are going to buy a bigger sieve
4:37
this feels so smooth
4:40
like it's very small it's making my work
4:43
hard
4:48
[Music]
4:54
so you guys have to do it until it's
4:57
like this when you can see the seeds
5:00
still you add some water
5:06
[Music]
5:18
my survey is really giving me a
5:19
difficult time like a very hard time but
5:22
it would be easier
5:24
if the sieve was bigger than this
5:27
so we are going to get a bigger sieve
5:29
sooner
5:31
[Music]
5:46
so after that
5:48
you put
5:50
this here
5:53
see these are the seeds so we don't
5:55
really need them
6:03
so guys after making after squeezing
6:06
from
6:07
this one
6:09
you add some sugar
6:20
and then you add
6:22
it in
6:24
the water
6:27
and then we have our passion juice
6:48
add more sugar
7:01
so you don't need a blender to make
7:02
juice you say you can use a seal
7:05
and you make your own juice at home
7:09
no chemicals no anything are they just
7:11
water and sugar
7:14
and the passion fruits
7:16
and then we are
7:18
ready to go cycle take a seat
7:30
hey this is the best juice ever
7:33
like seriously anyway
7:35
