5:35
like button and press the notification
5:37
bell
5:38
so if you have been watching my video
5:40
you know you know this house hey you
5:41
know our house
5:43
so today we are going to go on fresh
5:45
water it's evening not really is it
5:48
afternoon yeah it's evening but the sun
5:50
is still see sun is still high because
5:53
we are in i don't know not quite so the
5:55
sun is always here
5:57
uh today i'm going to go to fresh water
6:00
but thankful to their water is just near
6:02
why because our water like they're
6:05
bringing water into this village so the
6:07
water pipe blasted so people are fishing
6:10
water so i wanted to take you guys with
6:12
me and
6:13
let me get my thing
6:22
so i'm going to be using this
6:25
then carry some water
6:30
so let's go
6:40
so
6:51
so guys i was still doing the other
6:53
video then i decided to just add on this
6:56
other video on top of it
6:58
so the other one was very short and then
7:01
um we are going to fish water and i'm
7:03
like why not put all these videos
7:05
together to save you guys time
7:07
[Music]
7:08
uh so basically they were making the
7:10
road and then
7:12
they
7:14
cut one of the pipes that bring water
7:16
into my village so basically today we
7:18
are getting water for free and near my
7:21
home so that's what i was doing getting
7:23
water probably you would be asking
7:25
yourself why am i using the pot and
7:27
other people have jericho it's not that
7:29
everyone in my village uses a jericho so
7:31
some people use pots to fish water
7:33
others use jerichons
7:36
and others just use the pots to store
7:38
the water or keep the water so basically
7:41
it's your choice you can use either what
7:43
you want if you want a pot you can use a
7:46
pot if you want jericho you can use a
7:48
jericho
7:49
yeah
7:50
so that's it
7:52
but you can see most of those are kids
7:54
so kids really don't like cannot carry
7:56
water in pots so they prefer using jerry
7:59
cans
8:00
yeah even if they throw down jericho's
8:02
they can still manage take water home
8:06
yeah so what that by the way we don't
8:08
boil water
8:10
we just drink water right away from the
8:12
top we don't boil it
8:14
yeah and it's already safe people don't
8:17
really get diseases from that water
8:19
because that
8:20
that's what they have been taking from
8:22
when they were born so basically they
8:24
are immune their immune system is now
8:27
used to that
8:29
yeah so you make your attach that one is
8:32
to
8:34
protect your head and then the pot is
8:37
made of it's made out of clay so
8:39
basically you have to have something
8:41
soft and then you place it on it then
8:43
right away i go back home
8:46
so when i go home
8:49
actually it's near so
8:51
nothing to worry about it's very near so
8:54
just walk home and then take the water
8:56
straight inside the house as you can see
9:00
so we have to by the way i didn't carry
9:02
full i just carried that half of that
9:05
pot because i didn't have energy and it
9:07
was already evening
9:08
