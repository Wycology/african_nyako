hey guys welcome back to my youtube
0:15
channel in case you're new please
0:16
consider subscribing and if you're
0:18
married tiny subscriber thank you very
0:21
much i do really appreciate so today we
0:24
are going to be looking at how they make
0:28
mortar and a pistol in my village so
0:31
basically sit down watch this video
0:34
until the end
0:36
basically this is a fog
0:38
so
0:39
let's go into the video
0:41
so in my village you have one tribe that
0:44
is jenna but the tribe is made up of
0:48
several clans or subtracts anyway so i
0:51
come from one
0:53
clan that is called pasha and we have
0:55
myth so as you can see here we were
0:59
at a fork where they make knives
1:02
um
1:03
pangas
1:04
um seats like those round little stools
1:08
and um metal and a pistol
1:11
yeah so basically here they are lighting
1:14
up the fog so you have to have like
1:17
some charcoal and that
1:20
plastic this is a plastic bag a cavera
1:23
or a gutier
1:24
to be blowing
1:26
um
1:27
air into the fog so basically
1:30
they use the fire
1:32
to design the craft yeah design their
1:36
craft after
1:37
making them
1:38
you're going to be seeing that
1:40
throughout the video please
1:43
consider liking this video
1:45
so that you can give you a lot of
1:48
content to come please like this video
1:50
and subscribe to the channel in case
1:52
you've noticed subscribed
1:54
let's go into the video
1:59
so that's me basically
2:01
trying to blow the fog so that we can
2:05
start
2:06
you know so that was my first time doing
2:10
that seriously yet i come from this clan
2:12
but i had never
2:14
visited a form before or
2:16
done anything so basically women don't
2:19
really do that in my village for them
2:22
their work is to stay at home and cook
2:24
and take care of the family but for the
2:26
men they stay in the fog and then make
2:28
with crafts they go sell them and then
2:31
they still bring money home and feed
2:33
their families so basically work is
2:36
divided
2:37
to people according to their agenda men
2:41
do fishing and then do fog like they do
2:44
the fog war craft they
2:46
make chairs
2:56
so but then for the woman your work is
2:58
to stay home
2:59
and
3:00
go to the garden and fresh water
3:11
as you can see in the
3:14
video
3:23
so i really like this process but the
3:25
only thing i dislike about it was they
3:27
have to cut trees so basically the logs
3:29
that you're seeing behind there those
3:31
are trees ready to be
3:34
walked on so they cut trees so they get
3:37
them into the small logs that you see
3:39
behind i cannot zoom the video
3:42
so after getting the logs they make them
3:44
i think dry a bit
3:46
yeah for like one day
3:48
and then they start making whatever they
3:50
want to make out of them either they
3:52
make a stone or they make us
3:54
so today it was
3:56
a day for making motors that's why you
3:58
can only see them
4:01
so they start making the designs from a
4:04
log so these guys are really artists
4:07
like they know how to design things and
4:08
they never went to school for that
4:11
they just they are just talented or
4:14
you're just born doing that so basically
4:16
you gain skills with time
4:19
or you learn at work so these people act
4:21
all i can say they have learned at work
4:24
like they learn from work
4:27
so that's the process of making a motor
4:30
as you can see just get a look and then
4:33
you design it
4:34
so now you can see that it's not really
4:37
the end product because you still need
4:39
to have some final touches but basically
4:42
these ones they have already
4:44
made the shapes that they wanted from
4:45
the log and the sizes that they want so
4:48
they range from the biggest size to the
4:50
smallest size
4:52
yeah
4:53
so let's see how they do final touches
5:10
so kids are always playing like around
5:12
the place because that's their home you
5:14
know you can see the house back there
5:17
so here these are walking sticks they
5:20
are also made from the same place from
5:22
the same workshop or the fog yeah
5:26
so these sticks they are walking sticks
5:28
but they have a knife inside them
5:30
so after
5:32
making them from
5:34
from the stick or a tree
5:36
branch they have to get that
5:40
um
5:42
hot
5:43
a hot knife from the fog then they make
5:45
those designs that you can see and those
5:47
are the same designs that they can make
5:49
on the motor
5:51
so i never had i never got a chance to
5:54
meet someone designing a motor so i had
5:56
to bring for you people designing um
6:00
a walking stick maybe you can relate but
6:03
next time better yeah
6:06
so guys this is our final product as you
6:09
can see thank you for watching the video
6:12
bye
