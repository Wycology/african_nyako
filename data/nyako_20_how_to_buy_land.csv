1:27
of acquiring the land questions around
1:31
land acquisition so number one
1:33
set your budget draw a budget to
1:36
determine the type of land you will
1:38
be able to buy i understand so once you
1:42
know
1:42
that i have this kind of money this
1:45
amount of money and i want to buy land
1:47
to set up my building to set up my real
1:49
estates
1:50
so this kind of the first stage and then
1:52
this will bring us
1:54
to them like come
1:58
looking for land like how are you going
1:59
to look for land when you really
2:01
identify the land
2:04
site visit to the land or the property
2:06
make make a physical
2:08
site visit go there by yourself and
2:11
visit
2:11
you understand so when you visit then
2:14
you
2:15
have to know that yeah i think this is a
2:18
real thing or this is a real deal
2:20
so the land is visible so
2:23
for the physical inspection what do you
2:26
have to
2:27
look for look for place
2:30
that is near the main road or how far
2:33
is it to the main road how accessible is
2:36
it at night
2:37
or anytime when it rains you understand
2:40
so all the things should be under your
2:42
considerations
2:43
and then you have to know like is there
2:46
a water line
2:47
is there electricity like how easy is it
2:50
going to be for me to get power i
2:53
understand
2:54
schools hospitals all the services that
2:56
you would need as a human being so
2:58
make sure i first do a survey about all
3:01
those areas and find out if the place is
3:04
suitable
3:05
for you to stay in on doing your
3:07
investments
3:08
art so basically less about the physical
3:12
visit to the land side before purchasing
3:16
it and then the second stage like what
3:18
you have to do
3:19
appoint a lawyer to help you through the
3:21
process trust me
3:22
it's hectic like you cannot do the
3:25
things
3:26
alone so you have to make sure that you
3:28
have a lawyer
3:30
who will help you so a professional
3:32
lawyer advocate is a very crucial person
3:35
almost at all stage of the land
3:37
acquisition okay
3:39
if you want to purchase land you need a
3:41
lawyer
3:42
at least he will advise you on that
3:46
technically and what to do like you
3:49
advise your technical
3:50
what to do on each stage and you have to
3:53
make sure
3:54
that is facilitated but then if you have
3:58
someone that you can trust
4:01
who has like a lot of knowledge about it
4:04
then they can also help you do
4:06
that yeah so then after appointing a
4:09
letter to help you with the legal
4:10
processes or
4:12
taking you technically through the
4:14
process
4:16
you will need to do a land title search
4:20
in the land registration office however
4:23
you to do this one
4:26
so you can use the lawyer to verify the
4:27
authenticity of the
4:29
land title yeah through the
4:33
land title registrar's office
4:38
so they will do that what what do you
4:41
need
4:41
like to carry a reveal you need down
4:44
photocopy of the land title date from
4:47
the seller
4:48
so basically ask the seller to give you
4:50
the photocopy of the land title deed so
4:53
that you can
4:54
avail it for the registrar at the land
4:57
office registration
4:59
to go through it and then they can make
5:01
sure if that plan is for real
5:03
yeah once you are contented with as such
5:08
other results as that as presented by
5:12
the lawyer from the land registrar
5:15
you can now meet the owner and discuss
5:17
about the payment
5:19
so you can only meet the owner and
5:21
negotiate the price
5:23
after making sure that yeah the land
5:25
really exists
5:27
but then some people just go through the
5:30
blockers then they just
5:31
end up being corn so basically make sure
5:34
that you go with a photocopy
5:37
of the land title did then approve
5:40
they'll approve it to you that yeah the
5:41
land physically
5:43
is there like it exists so then go ahead
5:46
and then
5:47
um negotiate the price so when you
5:49
negotiate the price before doing the
5:51
payments please
5:52
use the professionals are there to
5:55
verify
5:56
the land size and the demarcations like
6:00
where does this land start where does
6:02
its top and how big is it
6:04
is the size the same that is claimed on
6:06
the paper alec on the land title
6:08
is it the same size or the alliance
6:11
or the other side was taken by the
6:14
uncle the relative so basically you have
6:16
to know that but then you have to
6:18
hire a professional surveyor to
6:21
do that yeah so basically what
6:25
what what i can still say on a survey
6:29
verifying the property size before
6:31
executing the transaction is very
6:34
essential get a professionally gestured
6:37
surveyor
6:38
to carry out a photographic survey
6:42
of the land and confirm to you the size
6:45
shape and identify the land boundaries
6:48
like
6:49
identify where the land boundaries are
6:52
then it will be
6:53
good for you to go so that brings us to
6:55
another
6:57
point which is um preparation for the
7:00
cell agreements
7:02
yeah so you can prepare and be like this
7:04
is how much i'm going to pay
7:06
according to this and that yeah so
7:10
when you do that then you can do the
7:12
purchase of the land
7:13
but then yeah after purchasing your land
7:16
show presents
7:18
your presence put a signpost and face
7:21
your land
7:22
put on the signposts that have like not
7:24
for sale
7:25
then your contact so that it has like
7:29
possession like anyone passing there
7:31
knows that that light is owned by
7:33
someone because if you leave it open
7:36
some people will impress your needs
7:42
or in the future you have problems that
7:45
i
7:45
learned was sold to some other people or
7:48
some other or have you learned title so
7:50
basically you have to be aware of that
7:52
because it happens and it's happening
7:54
and it will still happen
7:55
so be cautious about that so the payment
7:58
of the land rates
8:01
you must know the payment of the land
8:03
rates is
8:04
a legitimate requirement of land
8:06
ownership
8:08
and the seller should clear any pendant
8:11
rates on the property before completing
8:15
the transaction
8:16
so make sure before you complete the
8:17
transaction the seller the person
8:19
selling to your land
8:21
has cleared all the rates that we are
8:24
pending
8:25
on the land please note that because
8:28
you're going to do a
8:28
very great mistake buying land that has
8:31
a lot of money to pay
8:33
legally you understand so make sure
8:37
you also do that and that will bring us
8:39
to transfer the schmidt and
8:40
constant of the transfer
8:44
or land ownership to you
8:49
like you've already done the payments or
8:52
what is required actually the favorites
8:54
give them the money on
8:56
you have to transfer the document so the
8:59
seller should organize
9:01
so the person selling to you is required
9:04
to organize the transfer documents to be
9:06
executed by both parties and these
9:10
judgments will only be accomplished
9:12
following an issued consent to transfer
9:16
by the commissioner of
9:18
land like they will write to him
9:21
like it will be it will be a nice person
9:24
and he has to transfer ownership of that
9:27
land to you
9:28
basically through the dutch means the
9:30
land title then they will transfer
9:32
everything into your name
9:34
but then you might buy land then it has
9:36
someone's name and it'll be like oh the
9:38
person who is selling this
9:40
land this is your rope is not around
9:43
and then they're going to sell for you
9:44
the land that is not there
9:47
that is not there so the stamp duty
9:50
payment
9:52
the stamp duty payment this one
9:56
the buyer has the obligation to pay the
9:58
stamp duty
9:59
so for you who is buying not to know
10:02
this in your head
10:03
you have the obligation to pay that
10:05
taxes either the stamp duty
10:07
attacks left on land transaction for the
10:10
registration and
10:11
transfer purposes so if you want to
10:14
register that land
10:15
into your name and transfer ownership
10:17
you're going to pay for this
10:18
you're going to pay for this not that
10:21
you're going
10:22
so it is also imperative to know that
10:25
the registration
10:27
of transfer at that land office cannot
10:30
be executed not
10:32
until the stamp duty has been cleared
10:35
with the receipt to prove so once you do
10:38
the start duty
10:39
and you have a receipt that's when they
10:41
will do that transfer
10:43
the transfer into your lands and you own
10:46
the land
10:48
by yourself in this time so that is
10:51
then another one
10:54
so now you can purchase you can purchase
10:58
your
10:59
land after doing all the things then
11:03
but um when during a purchasing of the
11:05
land
11:06
is your presence like you go
11:10
on the land uh physically
11:16
if it's possible meet the owner like
11:19
the real owner otherwise
11:23
otherwise you will regret so it's
11:26
basically good
11:27
to meet the owner
11:31
yeah when you buy the land what else you
11:34
have to do
11:35
after you purchase the land fence it
11:38
fence the land and put a sign
11:40
poster put a poster including on it
11:43
land not first yeah after purchasing
11:46
your land show presents
11:47
your presence put a signpost and fence
11:50
your land
11:51
put on the sign posts that have like not
11:54
for sale then your contact
11:56
so that it has like possession like
12:00
anyone passing there knows that that
12:02
light is owned by someone
12:04
because if you leave it open some people
12:07
will
12:09
impressionate
12:12
or in the future you have problems that
12:15
are your land was sold to some other
12:17
people
12:18
or some other or have you learned title
12:20
so basically you have to be aware of
12:21
that because it happens and it's
12:23
happening and it will still happen
12:25
so be cautious about it so
12:28
after doing all that it's so unlikely
12:33
that someone can follow all those
12:35
procedures and still
12:36
be coined or cheated on land
12:40
but then therefore the good news is you
12:43
can use a lawyer
12:44
who will do all the transaction
12:47
and advise you on the necessary
12:49
transaction
12:50
and proof for the local ownership
