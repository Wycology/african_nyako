4:31

4:33

4:35
use today let's go and find out
4:47
you know these are bananas
5:08
and this is the
5:10
people like this is our community
5:11
basically so this video is like real
5:14
this these are people normal people
5:16
these are their houses
5:18
that's a he got right there we don't
5:20
take goods early in the morning to graze
5:23
we take them like at around midday
5:26
yeah for grazing
5:28
so let's go this is our neighbor's home
5:31
like neighbor to our garden not neighbor
5:33
to our home so neighbor to our garden
5:36
and then the next is our garden as you
5:40
can see there
5:42
but then people were already harvesting
5:45
the simpsons so i just had to join them
5:48
as you guys will be seeing in the video
6:11
so this is how we cut the sim sim you
6:14
just get that um
6:16
it's called the bringi in my language so
6:19
it's a knife but it's carved enough like
6:22
it's shaped in a carved way so that's
6:24
what you use as you guys can see there
6:28
you just use that to cut them and then
6:31
you
6:32
put them into bundles
6:34
after putting tying them into bundles
6:37
we shall put them to dry
6:39
on like timbers like we make something
6:42
like um
6:43
i don't know how it's called but i'll
6:45
show you guys
6:46
so and then when you make them together
6:49
in a bundle
6:50
tie them
6:52
like fasten them well and then we are
6:54
going to dry them and then we shall get
6:57
some same out of those
7:12
my
7:28
yeah
7:31
so this lady is better than me as you
7:33
can see what she's doing she's so fast
7:35
like she's faster than me so that's why
7:38
i had to capture for it for you guys to
7:40
see how they do it so basically that's
7:42
what they do you cut
7:44
a lot as you can
7:47
so when you cut them
7:49
you fasten them into a bundle
7:53
as you're going to be seeing what she's
7:55
doing so i have to make sure that you
7:57
cut as much as your hand can hold
8:01
before you fasten them
8:20
me
8:37
so that's how you fasten it you use some
8:40
three or four of them to just fasten
8:42
them like that
8:43
and make it across
8:45
and then put them where they have to be
8:48
put
8:49
so basically those ones are already the
8:51
bundles
8:52
and they are ready to be put into the
8:55
places of sun drying them as you can see
8:58
so me basically i was just collecting
9:01
them and putting them together so that
9:03
it will be easier for us to locate them
9:06
time for transferring them home
9:29
foreign
9:36
