0:17
sunshine like the sun is kissing me it's
0:20
just a morning a beautiful morning and
0:22
the sun is
0:23
so the sun is the right way there
0:26
kissing me right on my face yeah
0:28
so today we are going to do a typical
0:32
morning where
0:33
in the village how to brush to brush
0:36
your
0:37
teeth
0:38
so we are going to do it here using the
0:40
ash or black chakra and a brushing stick
0:44
people don't use
0:46
brushing toothbrush
0:49
here like a little percentage of people
0:52
use toothbrushes so let's not use a
0:54
toothbrush also today
0:57
let's use a stick that people here use
1:00
please watch the video till the end it's
1:03
gonna be interesting okay let's go into
1:05
the video
1:07
so so you guys i have to get a stick a
1:10
stick for brushing so here it is
1:17
so there are some specific sticks that
1:19
we use that are not bitter
1:21
like this one
1:26
that
1:28
organize it well
1:33
and you remove this
1:36
pet
1:37
that is sour or bitter
1:47
because this is going to go into your
1:49
mouth we have to make sure that it is
1:51
clean
1:54
so when you do that
1:56
then you
1:59
soften it a bit
2:03
even use this
2:09
so you have to soften this part that
2:10
you're going to put in your mouth
2:13
and then this is our hash
2:17
this one you get it from the
2:19
cooking place
2:21
and then this is the charcoal so you can
2:23
either use this or you can use the ashes
2:26
or you can use salt like table salt
2:29
or you can use water
2:32
yeah i think that's all
2:34
so let's use this today
2:36
so i have my water here this is the
2:38
water i used to wash my face all right
2:43
this is before
2:48
actually we don't use anything joshua
2:50
face soap what no just plain water in
2:52
the cup
2:53
as you can see
2:58
and then wash your brush very well your
2:59
toothbrush
3:01
or stick and then get it
3:05
and dip it here
3:07
and then start brushing
3:36
so you can get the charcoal and pound it
3:39
into powder and then use it or you can
3:42
get charcoal and pass it through your
3:44
tip like this
3:46
it will also work
3:48
so whatever you want but me today i'm
3:50
only using this
4:09
hmm
4:15
so the good thing about this
4:17
can help you brush
4:19
your teeth
4:21
one by one effectively
4:24
don't leave anything that is so this is
4:25
what everyone uses they say everywhere
4:29
no
4:30
not everyone it's all that people cannot
4:32
afford that it's right so some people do
4:35
so they buy it and other people don't
4:36
see it
4:37
necessary they think buying a toothbrush
4:39
is so luxury luxurious
4:43
yeah
4:44
so they cannot they don't buy the other
4:47
they rather use the money to buy
4:49
something else
4:51
than a toothbrush
4:53
so
4:54
that's it i think you guys have got i've
4:56
not done it like perfectly because i
4:58
don't use this trust me every day me i
5:00
use it with brush
5:02
so i was just trying to show you what
5:04
some people do in my village yeah so
5:07
let's go and have our breakfast today by
5:10
the roadside like our street food
5:12
because we're going to cook breakfast at
5:14
home today so let's go
5:20
so guys we are going to go and have our
5:22
breakfast so this is my outfit for today
5:25
yeah this is my two days out
5:27
so we are going to go and have breakfast
5:30
right now
5:31
in the streets
5:33
the village streets you understand like
5:35
we are we're not cooking in the kitchen
5:37
today we are having a luxurious life
5:40
lifestyle
5:42
let's go into the video anyway
5:57
uh
6:14
thank you
6:26
so guys here we had reached the place
6:29
where they prepare breakfast so
6:32
what you can have for breakfast in this
6:34
place is anoya that is basically
6:39
beans mixed with maize corns
6:43
so as you can see then they put some oil
6:46
that has onion in it and it makes for
6:48
you
6:49
that's what you can have so we came in a
6:52
bit very early that's why we couldn't
6:54
find a variety of what to choose from
6:57
but usually they have pancakes
7:00
and donuts
7:03
but the local ones so but we are so
7:05
early because we had to do some things
7:07
in the morning so we had to first come
7:10
and take breakfast and then go catch up
7:11
with our daily work so we couldn't wait
7:14
for other vendors
7:18
that is our common street food
7:25
so we had to get two plates that one
7:28
plate
7:29
mine and the other foot was for the
7:30
camera open
7:32
or raise anyway
7:34
so and then
7:35
their tea wasn't ready so we had to
7:37
order 40 from someone else
7:40
who brought for us the tea animals
7:44
she's adding some oil in it
7:47
i don't really like the oil bit of it i
7:50
just prefer eating it without oil
7:53
you know but it's always more delicious
7:56
with oil so yeah that's it and then we
7:58
have to look for where to sit that's
8:00
like a mini restaurant where everyone
8:03
sees
8:06
all right
8:08
breakfast that's right so that man had
8:10
already eaten his breakfast and he was
8:13
giving the ladybug
8:16
i don't know that's afraid
8:19
anyway
8:20
so that was me having my anja for my
8:24
breakfast and waiting for my tea to be
8:27
brought
8:28
so that i can accompany it with the tea
8:31
so there is the tea it is a black tea
8:35
basically water put you put in sugar and
8:38
some
8:40
and some tea tea leaves yeah but
