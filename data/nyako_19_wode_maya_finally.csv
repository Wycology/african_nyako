1:19
so admire started the video that
1:21
interview saying that
1:23
if you type poe de maya on youtube their
1:26
videos will pop up
1:28
why why are their video popping up this
1:31
is because they have
1:32
his name in his in their channels
1:35
in things that even doesn't know so he
1:38
also
1:38
said that ayamara has the same title
1:43
like his video in thousands done
1:45
that he did in masailand
1:48
so basically he said he has been
1:50
watching all his videos
1:53
why do you come to public to turn
1:56
peoples
1:56
to to turn people against me say eduardo
1:59
maya
2:00
mara you have to fix yourself first
2:03
wow yeah mara you have to fix yourself
2:06
first
2:07
so if you have a problem with me
2:10
saying if you have a problem with me fix
2:13
yourself first say dwight
2:14
maya he also said he loves them all
2:17
and they should learn to collaborate and
2:20
that's why he has
2:22
to he has a t-shirt called don't hate
2:25
corroborate learn from each other
2:28
and we are not here for the fame we are
2:32
here
2:32
for the impact wow that was so nice and
2:36
if you are on youtube to make money for
2:38
that short time
2:40
please stop it say edward meyer
2:44
wow this is so nice of you he keeps
2:47
asking himself
2:48
what he did to ayamara but he can't find
2:52
it
2:53
he said it's not worth it to hate anyone
2:56
and he doesn't hate them and they always
2:59
watch his
3:00
like their videos wow that's so nice
3:04
so he went on and said he's not afraid
3:08
of
3:08
anybody if he should be scared off he
3:11
should be scared of terror
3:13
but he has been working with thai so
3:15
when they may also ask himself
3:17
and he was like mara why do you come to
3:20
public
3:21
to tarnish people against me punish my
3:24
name
3:25
like serious why do you do that oh
3:29
and then he said he watches all their
3:32
videos everybody was warm like
3:34
after someone talking about you this is
3:37
like the
3:38
brotherhood we should have understand
3:41
so he also said that i am
3:46
the same titles of the video with him
3:48
basically
3:49
just gets whatever he's doing
3:52
and puts the same thing about it i
3:54
watched a marantz
3:56
live stream and he was like it's okay to
3:58
copy internet it's about
4:00
coping yeah so that's what he said
4:03
it's okay to copy and then it's about
4:06
copying so
4:07
then what they might have said every
4:09
time you type iron mara
4:11
their videos will pop up whatever
4:19
so basically can it be like could it be
4:22
a trick of them trending on youtube
4:27
how you people anyway
4:30
let's not hate each other let's work
4:32
together i also said we can collaborate
4:34
if you
4:35
want to make africa a better place
4:39
yeah so let's go in and continue saying
4:42
whatever i
4:43
say i'll be touching them
4:46

4:51
so what do you learn from this video
4:53
this video
4:55
where well maya's video his response to
4:57
di mango
4:58
and ayamara he is a very understanding
5:02
man
5:03
he took time and he said you would not
5:06
reply to those two ask people's videos
5:10
on his channel so when he had an
5:12
interview that's
5:13
when he came out and said actually when
5:15
all the things happened
5:17
he was even in the forest he didn't know
5:19
anything that was
5:20
coming or going on the internet after
5:23
two days in the forest when he magnus
5:25
went boom he found out whatever has been
5:27
saturating on
5:28
youtube and he just kept quiet
5:32
so he went ahead and said he has nothing
5:36
against these people and really loves
5:38
them
5:40
and they've been tagging him on like
5:43
in their video and has no problem with
5:45
this so that shows
5:47
like it shows us how good this
5:50
man is or boy i don't know
5:54
and um i went through the comment
5:57
section and saw people
5:58
also reacting to how he responded to
6:03
mara and tim wango
6:06
i'll be tagging some comments that
6:08
caught my eyes
6:09
so basically so this comment really
6:12
caught
6:13
my eyes the person was what the man is
6:15
planning to do charity
6:18
like seriously yeah building a school
6:21
and also
6:22
to help people on the streets touch
6:24
people's life that is how great mind
6:26
distinct
6:27
himself unlike others who make money
6:30
from their fans and first thing they do
6:33
is to put
6:33
building and buy and buy land so
6:36
basically it's not bad to do like these
6:39
people
6:39
who are building it's okay you people
6:42
it's okay as long as we can
6:43
all work together africa will be a
6:46
