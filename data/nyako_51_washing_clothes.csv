0:22
at the stream we call it a dam yeah at
0:26
the dam
0:27
so these are my vincent too
0:30
and
0:32
these are the clothes we are going to
0:34
watch you can see them here
0:37
so these are the smells
0:39
we are
0:40
going to wash you cannot do your laundry
0:43
from home because we don't have a tap we
0:46
don't have anything so you have to go at
0:49
the stream
0:50
or the river
0:52
or at the dam but the river is very fast
0:56
because these are clothes for staying at
0:58
home so we can basically wash them from
1:00
the dam
1:02
let's go
1:03
let me
1:05
stick
1:12
okay guys let's go please if you've not
1:14
yet subscribed to my video subscribe
1:16
right now because i'm doing all this for
1:17
you guys
1:36
circle
1:55
so you guys we have been working for
1:58
about
2:00
40 minutes
2:01
it's really very fast
2:03
so we are almost there
2:06
see you but there's a shortcut here
2:09
maybe i can use the straight cut though
2:11
it's really risky
2:13
but i have to use this people so that
2:16
i can reach
2:38
yes
2:44
so you guys this is
2:55
please subscribe
3:04
um
3:29
so this place is very slippery
3:32
but i'm trying
3:35
not to fall
3:37
you have to make sure you get the
3:38
cleanest water around
3:42
so this is clean
3:55
bottom
4:04
yes
4:19
so this is the soap we use
4:22
it's a blue soap
4:29
so when you fresh the water you first
4:31
make it set off a little bit
4:33
and then you can use other pencils to
4:36
sieve it or a clove i did not show you
4:39
guys the procedure but maybe next time
4:41
because it's going to rain so we are out
4:44
of time i have to do it so fast
4:47
so that we can go home and not be beaten
4:50
by that raindrops
4:53
so that's why i never showed you guys on
4:56
the procedure
4:58
but this is a short video
5:03
maybe next time i can do for you a
5:04
detailed one
5:07
but this is basically what i do so we
5:10
always wear
5:12
this these are african fabrics that's
5:14
why you can see there are many of them
5:15
here so that's what that's our
5:17
traditional dress
5:20
so basically that's what you wear here
5:30
so you guys i think i'll just show you
5:32
when i'm done for now
5:34
i can stop the video here
5:37
