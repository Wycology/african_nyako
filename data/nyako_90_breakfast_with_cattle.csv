so that they don't still

2:25
okay
2:58

3:15
this is how we
3:16
built chicken house
3:22
in two sections as you can see this is
3:24
the big one where everyone stays and
3:26
someone will stay here those ones that
3:28
like
3:29
not like breaking either we put them
3:32
here and then the newcomers we put them
3:34
in here
3:36
bringing new chicken you know it takes
3:38
long to get used
3:40
and this is
3:41
where they take it's a bigger
3:44
you can drink that this is where they
3:46
drink water from and this is where we
3:48
feed them
3:50
this is their chicken feed
3:55
and then this one is
4:10
and put it's made out of mace
4:13
like the maize
4:15
cob and whatever
4:21
when they want to eat them
4:37
okay
4:48
oh
4:56
the head of the family
4:58
so guys yeah let's go and see that
5:01
chicken
5:02
ah like what's where is
5:23
so we leave this like this right when
5:25
they pick it's not wait for them
5:28
this is like a small baby coat
5:32
it's cute
5:35
it has these things
5:40
it has the ticks on it
5:45
see
5:46
it has been eating it
5:49
it's
5:50
bloody
6:02
these are some of the words because this
6:04
house cannot fit all of them other than
6:06
down there
6:07
this is a she boat
6:11
all of them
6:32
so right now they are
6:34
talking together
6:58
let's go and see the
7:00
cows
7:25
so this is how they milk how
7:41
okay
7:47
milk that they have got from the cow
7:50
i don't know if you guys are seeing yeah
7:52
that's the milk
8:07
you guys
8:24
um
8:39
yes
8:45
[Music]
8:54
and the little ones look nice
8:58
they curves
9:09
so right now they are still here they're
9:11
from milking them
9:13
when they finish milking they cannot
9:15
check
9:17
because they cannot take it outside for
9:19
grazing because
9:22
they are still like it's still
9:24
wet outside the grass i like this one
9:28
the way she is i think she's
9:33
you see they all have the same prince
9:36
that's the mother the leg like the back
9:39
legs
9:40
there and then here
9:43
i think she's just a newborn
9:47
so you guys
9:49
this is our cows
9:54
you people i fear cows that's the fact
9:56
i'm just here but i feel that's why i've
9:58
never brought you guys yet to see how i
10:00
come so this cows
10:02
are for my family
10:04
like the whole family is not only one
10:06
person i told you if you this is why
10:08
they bring like food
10:10
if you want to marry me you have to
10:12
bring cows like um
10:14
first you can bring like 15 cows
10:17
and 18 goats
10:19
and money
10:20
so
10:21
if you have the cows please you're
10:23
welcome you're going to add on these
10:24
ones
10:27
so some of them they were brought
10:30
as they were
10:31
when they were when my sister was
10:33
getting married like my cousin sister
10:36
these are some of the cows they brought
10:38
seven of them
10:40
yeah so when when you're going to get
10:42
married like you if you're marrying a
10:44
woman in my tribe
10:47
they will value that lady with cows it's
10:50
so sad but they'll tell you if she's if
10:53
she's educated that's like those are
10:55
more cows
10:56
if she's
10:58
semilicious they won't be that long but
11:01
yeah
11:02
you give like five cows or food and if
11:06
you never went to sleep
11:09
okay
11:11
so you give like three cows so it
11:14
depends
11:15
and if you make a lady pregnant before
11:17
before you back their home still they'll
11:19
ask you for cows
11:22
so
11:23
make
11:24
things easier for you first got their
11:27
home negotiate their diary
11:29
then you can start making babies
11:32
otherwise
11:35
other ways
11:37
they'll give you fine
11:40
they'll charge you a lot
11:43
so
11:45
this is our cause you guys that never
11:47
show new cars
11:51
a little bit there's a day that you saw
11:54
milking is the one who takes care of
11:56
them
11:57
you will be taking them to great level
12:00

12:02
it
12:03
