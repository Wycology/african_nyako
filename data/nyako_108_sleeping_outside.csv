0:00
like from our ancestors when they
0:02
discovered that the place is hot
0:05
they had to get a solution for it
0:08
and the solution was to sleep outside
0:11
so people used to fear night dances that
0:14
they had dance
0:15
i tried to shoot this video several
0:17
times but we don't have lights i'm using
0:19
like that
0:21
the
0:22
torch too top shading so this is the
0:24
water
0:25
i told you
0:27
that i already shower outside during
0:30
the night time i don't know why this is
0:32

0:46
our evening routine like where we sleep
0:48

0:59
dry season it's very hot here in my
1:02
village
1:03
so i shower late after eating my supper
1:06

1:33
shower from now i want to show you where
1:36
we sleep so after that we cut we sleep
1:39
outside not because we don't have a
1:41
house get me right
1:43
not because we don't have a house we
1:45
don't have houses around
1:47
but it's really very hot
1:50
hot as in the heat is too much
1:53
so everyone when you move back around

1:56
10 p.m
1:58
when you move around in every compound
2:00
here in the village you'll find people
2:02
sleeping
2:03
you find people sleeping in the compound
2:06
so let me show you i'm not talking
2:09
loudly because people are already
2:11
sleeping here
2:12
and i don't want to make noise for them
2:17
[Music]
2:22
yeah so now let me also lay my bed let
2:25

3:54
at once
4:01
so guys yeah it's like we have a camp a
4:04

4:12
angelia we are having it for breakfast
4:19
so you guys can't see but i'll show you
4:21
guys tomorrow morning when it's ready
4:24
so for now
4:26
let me sleep and when you're sleeping
4:28
you have to watch out for night dancers
4:30
because they come every day i'm kidding
4:35
no night dancers
4:38
so
4:40
what you do here you sleep we have this
4:42
thing
4:45
we don't try like i'm not making an
4:47
advice for them so
4:49
so this all the most is a mosquito
4:51
repellent like he smeared
4:55
just get this
4:57
then smear flat mosquitoes don't bite
5:00
i always put it even on my face
5:04
a little bit so
5:06
the mosquitoes cannot bite you and you
5:08
sleep till morning without any
5:11
disturbance
5:12
and if you want to go and pee you just
5:14
move behind the house and you pee and
5:18
you come back
5:19
yeah
5:21
no not only to make no white animals as
5:24
you guys think
5:25
it's safe because everyone is sleeping
5:28
also
5:29
and that's the way of life here
5:32
like from our ancestors when they
5:35
discover that the place is hot they had
5:38
to get a solution for it and the
5:41
solution was to sleep outside
5:44
so people used to fear night dancers
5:46
that there are people who dance at night
5:48
or night runners but i've never seen one
5:52
i've never but they always tell us that
5:55
our neighbor
