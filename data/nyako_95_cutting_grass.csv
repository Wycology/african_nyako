that we use to build our hearts
2:33
our houses
2:35
so here is my water but i got the pastel
2:37
they went to cut theirs down there but
2:40
maybe i'm cutting here because i've been
2:42
going that place like that half a place
2:44
and i'm tired
2:46
so today i'm doing it here and i'll show
2:48
you so this is what we use to do it
2:52
to tie the brush so let me show you guys
2:54
how we do
3:01
so this is dabrini
3:10
are you guys saying what i'm doing
3:16
see
3:17
within one second i've got this
3:20
and i'm a pro you know i'm i'm lazy in
3:23
other things but when it comes to this
3:25
trust me i'm a professional
3:35
[Applause]
3:37
see
3:40
so imagine i'm getting this
3:43
every second and we need a hip like this
3:45
big use we need a hip of it like this
3:48
big
4:01
so other people like in gulu
4:04
mothers you'll tell me if in google you
4:06
use this but i think you guys use a beer
4:09
and the beer is called elephant grass if
4:11
i'm not mistaken i don't know how this
4:13
one is called in english
4:15
so some people don't use i think this
4:16
one is only used here in taquer
4:20
but this is stronger than the one those
4:22
people use
4:24
so this one in my tribe in my language
4:26
is called loom okay loom is like grass
4:29
so this is loom odd
4:30
brush
4:32
for building the house or for the house

6:29
to dry it after drying it

6:38
yeah to do all that
6:40
but then i'll see you guys when i'm
6:42
going home but i think i've showed you
6:44
this is the type of grasp
6:55
so this is the one i've already cut but
6:58
i put them like this where they can dry
7:00
by the time um
7:01
so if you carry them when they're like
7:03

7:07
i need to first dry them a bit and
7:09
