0:20
is simpson
0:22
simpson paste
0:24
from the sim sim
0:26
so this is the sim sim
0:30
this is the simpson grain yeah they're
0:32
called grains yeah
0:34
so i'm going to make some sim paste out
0:37
of this
0:38
and if you want to know how they do it
0:42
stick onto this video wash it till the
0:44
end then you will get to know how they
0:47
do simpson paste from the samsung grains
0:51
so what you have to do first is to wash
0:53
this so i'm going to wash them because
0:55
they don't really look nice
0:57
and then i'll roast them
0:59
after resting them
1:01
then you're going to see
1:03
another or the next process so keep into
1:06
the video and don't forget to give it a
1:08
thumbs up
1:12
so
1:17
so you wash it you put water in it
1:21
and then you get your saucepan
1:27
and you do this
1:45
okay let me do it on here
1:48
my suspend is big but
1:51
we shall manage
1:53
don't worry be happy
1:56
everything is gonna be all right
2:01
so everything is going to be all right
2:03
just use this big saucepan
2:06
don't worry
2:10
so after washing it you put it on the
2:12
saucepan and place it on the fire so
2:15
this is what you have just done
2:23
so
2:24
after putting that into the pan
2:27
we don't use a mingle like stick we use
2:30
this
2:32
this is a broom
2:33
for sweeping the house but we use it
2:37
for rusting the same seam also so that's
2:39
why i've got this
2:41
that's what they use i don't know why
2:42
don't ask me why we use this but i think
2:45
because they are so tiny
2:47
so this can handle them
2:55
so you hold them like this like
2:57
chopsticks is it how the whole
2:59
chopsticks
3:01
let me know if chinese under support who
3:04
live in china
3:06
okay in this canyon please tell me how
3:08
you hold your chopsticks is it like this
3:12
so that's how you have to hold this
3:14
and then
3:17
and then you do like this okay
3:23
so this is how you roast it
3:29
make sure there is nothing on the
3:31
saucepan
3:32
like sticking on the suspense they are
3:35
all done getting enough fire
3:38
and then you're good to go
3:41
so within a few minutes it will be done
3:45
rested all well
3:59
so make sure they are all intact you see
4:14
we had to shift to this
4:16
firewood
4:18
fireplace because the cigarette was
4:21
taking long
4:22
so i had to shift here
4:25
because i had to keep time
4:27
they think it's going to be for our
4:29
lunch
4:30
so i had to do it from the firewood
4:35
i don't know if it's only me but i find
4:38
charcoal so so slow
4:40
but firewood is always fast when you're
4:42
cooking
4:44
so
4:45
i prefer using firewood to
4:48
crackle
4:53
so guys the only way that you can know
4:55
that they are getting ready when they
4:56
start popping and making those little
4:58
sounds like popcorns but in a tiny tiny
5:02
form i don't know if it's tiny
5:05
but turn your hair
5:07
can you hear the sound that's when you
5:10
know that they are ready
5:19
and you have to test
5:36
this is now ready
5:38
i have to put it here
5:49
so you can see now we are going to go
5:51
and grind them on the grinding stone
5:55
so
5:56
keep into the video watch the video till
5:58
the end you're going to know how they do
6:00
this
6:02
it's my little magic here
6:06
so when you put it on your tray like
6:08
this make sure you
6:12
okay make sure you do like this i'm not
6:14
going to i don't know if this is
6:15
winnowing i don't really know but you do
6:18
it nicely
6:20
english is not my language so
6:22
bear with me if i don't speak a proper
6:24
word
6:25
in english as long as i can do the
6:27
actions huh
6:31
yeah so then after this thing
6:34
ours is a big one so this one is for our
6:37
grandmother
6:39
but then when you're going to use it you
6:41
have to make sure so this is banana leaf
6:43
you have to you put it here
6:46
so that's when you're doing the power
6:47
there
6:48
in your tongue
6:54
so you get food like kosher this is from
6:58
cassava flour
6:59
that's what you use to clean you do like
7:02
this
7:04
and you clean you clean the stone very
7:06
well
7:08
very well
7:12
make sure that stone is clean you see
7:15
that's the only way to clean the stone
7:22
so that you can work on a clean surface
7:33
so i think it's good to go
7:36
then a small one
7:37
you clean it
7:41
clean it well
7:46
and then you start
7:47
get this
7:49
over here
7:56
and then
7:57
this
8:02
so you hold it like this
8:08
and make sure you can use either sides
8:10
and make sure one hand is here but this
8:12
one can be putting them
8:25
no i didn't before i don't
8:27
have to increase the surface area
8:50
so the first one is always rough
8:52
but then we shall do the second one the
8:54
second round
8:56
it will be good to go
9:11
make sure it doesn't pull it down
9:15
like on the sides just aim at one side
9:21
so this is how we make our sim simpest
9:36
so guys i had to bring in an expat who
9:39
knows how to do this
9:41
and here she is
9:52
i think i wasn't doing it nicely
9:56
oh my god
9:59
so this is how we do it
10:06
huh
11:10
so after grinding the simpson paste you
11:14
put it in the
11:15
food as you can see in the video please
11:18
subscribe
11:34
you
