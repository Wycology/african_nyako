and press notification bell so that we
0:38
can dive into our video today
0:40
so basically i'll be looking down
0:41
because i've noted something down
0:44
about the dating staffs in uganda
0:47
let's start with the video so dating in
0:49
uganda
0:50
let's start with the men what do they
0:53
men want
0:54
like do you know what they want
0:58
i got you number one
1:01
they like brown skinned
1:05
girls or light-skinned girls if you're
1:09
light or
1:12
half cast or a mixed
1:16
kid mixed race you are
1:20
you've got it you've got it my dear here
1:24
if you light skinned in uganda you've
1:27
got it
1:28
and if you're dark like me my sister sit
1:30
down
1:33
so if your neck right there see that's
1:35
how they like
1:37
light-skinned girls you should not that
1:40
yeah they don't it's so sad that people
1:42
still think
1:43
that way but then you cannot blame
1:46
someone because
1:47
people are attracted differently to so
1:50
if they find like skates so attractive
1:52
to them
1:54
but according to my research yeah most
1:56
men and you're going to find
1:58
brown-skinned girls so so attractive
2:01
to them compared to the dark skins i'm
2:04
dark-skinned but i don't complain i love
2:06
my complexion so
2:08
then another thing what do you want and
2:10
men want
2:11
big bombs if you have a big bat
2:16
if you have a big bird in uganda trust
2:18
me
2:19
you are you are teaching at the dating
2:21
game like
2:22
i remind you you're new i don't know
2:25
what
2:26
they want with the bombs but trust me
2:30
that's what they want yeah
2:33
so you can go to they're gonna live what
2:35
do you gonna make this want like what do
2:37
the ugandan
2:38
girls want when it comes to dating like
2:41
what's their point of preference whom do
2:43
they prefer
2:44
to death or which kind of guys do
2:47
they want to date line number one
2:50
they want a rich guy
2:55
not like rage as long as you have money
2:57
to give them
2:58
so yeah you should not have money
3:01
without the money
3:02
yeah that's point number one trust me so
3:05
that has
3:05
made most of the young girls going for
3:08
sugar diabetes so i can't say that
3:10
society
3:11
people like young individuals go for
3:13
sugar daddies just because of that
3:15
it has been even seen through the
3:18
celebrities
3:19
all the young celebrities
3:23
have like these city tycoons older than
3:26
them
3:27
just because they are giving them money
3:29
and supporting them
3:30
you know yeah so that's it it's a
3:33
pity but that's what's happening so i
3:35
have to talk about it
3:37
then young girls like gamblers
3:40
what do i mean by gobblers guys who just
3:43
dress up well like
3:44
white tops new cars jeans like they're
3:47
all
3:48
smart but then they don't have anything
3:49
in the pocket
3:51
so girls tend to fall for such guys here
3:55
another thing we like are foreigners
3:58
if a guy says oh i'm not from uganda be
4:02
like wow
4:03
i'm from this country i'm from rwanda
4:05
i'm from as long as you're not from
4:07
uganda and when that
4:08
girl will fall for you or maybe if i'm
4:11
lying
4:13
yeah all that you got anything okay um
4:16
this is like my research
4:19
so basically there are people who want
4:22
falling for this but then the majority
4:25
and
4:25
this is my research like mine
4:28
yeah you can also do yours and let me
4:30
know in the comments below
4:32
but that's what i've found out even in
4:34
high school with someone
4:35
like when you have a international
4:38
student like all the girls could be over
4:40
here
4:47
what can i say about this um
4:50
most yoga than or even girls or men
4:55
when they start dating with a white
4:58
person
4:58
or a caucasian they think they've made
5:01
it in life
5:05
they think the guy has money so your
5:07
friends will start asking you oh does he
5:09
have money
5:10
[Music]
5:12
oh my god you guys know these things
5:16
so that's like the interracial is still
5:18
hyped so so
5:19
hyped i don't know why for some reasons
5:24
yeah so dead settings how do people in
5:27
uganda set their dates
5:31
that setting yeah so basically
5:35
they go for food night dinner
5:40
like they go for dinner deaths
5:44
yeah but then what you have
5:47
to have into your mind give a transport
5:51
spencer's money
5:53
even if you've come and picked her from
5:55
her home taking off for lunch
5:57
when she's and you drop her back this is
5:59
so funny
6:00
like pick her drop her back but still
6:02
give her transport money
6:05
yeah the day i went and girl will check
6:09
you because you didn't give her
6:10
transport my dear
6:13
they will come and comment here in this
6:14
video anyway so give her transport
6:17
after taking that her it even if she has
6:20
footed like when the place is just
6:22
near there it's for footy give her a
6:24
transport even if she has used the
6:25
border board and you've seen that
6:27
somebody would still give her transport
6:30
if i transport and you will thank me
6:32
later
6:33
so how can you win an abandoned girl
6:38
let's go into this how can you win a
6:40
random girl
6:41
you said i get obviously sweeten it
6:46
ask her when she's free i'll be like oh
6:48
i was planning we can go find it
6:50
such a such a thing here this restaurant
6:53
like
6:53
they send it after that give a transport
6:56
money
6:58
when you give a transport money that's
7:00
like registration
7:03
i'm kidding just give a transport money
7:05
anyway
7:07
don't ask her age like if she's not free
7:11
with telling your age please don't ask
7:14
her or someone may be like oh i'm 23
7:16
years then you believe
7:18
i look older than 23 how do you know are
7:21
you me
7:21
are you mean are you me
7:25
so don't ask her age
7:29
so call her when she wishes home
7:32
call her ask her she has reached safely
7:35
so where you're securing your second
7:37
date
7:39
yeah thank me lady so when you call her
7:42
then you can talk about the debt
7:44
sit another day another day for a debt
7:48
yeah and another thing
7:53
okay anyway let's stop there then let's
7:57
go into
7:58
things that you can that can make you
8:01
tell
8:02
that a good man girl doesn't love you
8:05
or she's just using you number one
8:10
when she meets you and asks you
8:13
to buy a phone
8:17
a phone yeah she'll ask you to buy a
8:20
phone
8:21
immediately when she meets you so
8:24
basically like who does that i've just
8:27
seen you and you want a fonda
8:29
another thing and she asks you for money
8:33
because like seriously if you have a
8:35
sense of
8:36
attraction or you're attracted to
8:38
someone
8:40
why do you like do you even get the guts
8:42
of asking me for
8:43
money
8:49
and i think if she brings her friends
8:52
with her for a date let me say you set a
8:55
date for you guys to go
8:57
somewhere or in a restaurant eat
9:00
then she comes along with her four
9:03
friends or three friends or two friends
9:07
as you whatever it friends trust me
9:09
first thing
9:10
it's a red black she doesn't love you
9:12
she's just trying out probably she has
9:14
more than two guys like she's
9:17
all she has come with her friends to
9:19
evaluate you you understand
9:21
good things
9:25
so if she doesn't talk let me say after
9:28
that then she doesn't talk to you at
9:29
night
9:30
run run no don't stay there
9:34
run so even how she introduces you to
9:38
her friends
9:39
matters be like hey meet my friend
9:44
meet my friend so you have to read her
9:48
friend's reactions
9:49
on the face which introduced because
9:51
they know everything probably they know
9:53
if you're that guy or you're just
9:56
you know passing oh they're just passing
9:58
by
10:01
anyway i hope this helps
10:04
actually that's a little bit
10:08
