4:10
it's really dirty because you have been
4:12
walking we have been walking i don't
4:13

4:16
almost an hour now but we are just we
4:19
can't see where we are going we can see
4:20
the future is bright now
4:23
let's go hopefully we find when they
4:25
haven't
4:26
got outside the fish like from the boat
4:29
let's go and i think i'll show you if we
4:31
find when they have not yet got them out
4:34
so i wanted to show you guys the process
4:35
of getting the fish from the river and
4:38
then selling it
4:53
hey
5:06
guys i think you can see the river now
5:09
please we haven't reached but bear with
5:11
me be patient watch the video till the
5:14
end cause more to come is just a blast
5:17
so that is the river it's the river nail
5:20
so the rivener comes from
5:22
ginger
5:23
ginger is in central central kampala i'm
5:26
in central uganda
5:28
so it comes through
5:30
from the eastern part of uganda
5:33
to the west nile part of uganda i don't
5:36
know if you know karuma falls here
5:38
so and then it comes here in pakwas
5:42
so it's flowing
5:43
to sudan
5:45
through sudan to egypt
5:48
through egypt to the mediterranean sea
5:51
that's where this river flows to so it's
5:53
from the
5:55
eastern part of uganda through the west
5:58
nile part of uganda like
6:00
north west part because we are in north
6:02
west part of uganda
6:04
and then it will go through south sudan
6:08
to egypt
6:10
to the mediterranean sea so this is the
6:12
river fresh our water from we do fishing
6:15
here so we are the people that stay
6:17
along the river cause we eat fish so
6:21
let's go please bear with me because
6:22
this video is gonna be long but
6:25
you guys deserve this cause i'm doing
6:27
this all for you guys let's go
6:41
[Applause]
6:46
is
6:55
here as a river because they don't want
6:57
like people to just do their business
6:59
around the river so they keep their
7:01
sanitation by building a latrine here so
7:04
this is the latrine they use
7:07
just enter
7:09
i don't want to enter
7:10
anyway you go inside and do your
7:12
business and then you go at the river
7:16
here we have just reached let's go and
7:18
see what is there
7:29
[Music]
7:31
so guys here we had reached the landing
7:34
site that's where the river is and
7:37
unfortunately we have missed the part
7:40
where they are bringing the fish from
7:41
the boat so basically they got the fish
7:43
and put it here
7:45
on the thing i don't know how they call
7:47
it in english
7:48
so that's where they put the fish and
7:51
then people can start buying the fish so
7:54
we managed to buy some fish for our
7:56
lunch as you will see at the end of the
7:59
video the fish that we purchased so
8:01
that's the beautiful view of the sunrise
8:03
reflection in the
8:05
river nail so basically it looks
8:08
beautiful isn't it let me know from the
8:11
comment if you think this is a very nice
8:13
view anyway so let me get the boat
8:17
and we go into the river before i have
8:20
to take you through like we're not just
8:22
stopping here we are going through so
8:25
that's that beautiful sunrise
8:30
so this is the boat they used to fish
8:33
as you can see
8:38
huh and this is the thing they used to
8:41
run together
8:43
they use it to roll their boats
8:46
hopefully you guys i'm going to show you
8:48
this thing so be patient
8:51
[Applause]
9:04
one thing
9:10

9:12

13:00
comes up is it a pilot
13:03
i'm the captain yeah it's the captain
13:05
i'm the captain now taking us back
13:09
you see how i know how to do things i'm
13:11
soon getting my own button starting a
13:14
new business
13:16
of sailing people across the river so
13:20
you guys can come if you want to come to
13:22
uganda you can come and then you book my
13:24
boat and we go
13:28
i'm now an expert in only a few minutes
13:30
i've become an expert
13:41
[Music]
14:05
hello
14:27
so guys we finally made it back to the
14:30
landing site here you can see i was the
14:33
one
14:34
leading the way
14:36
anyway we made it back and
14:39
there's one boat that they are repairing
14:42
there hope i'm going to get a chance to
14:44
show it to you guys and then some fish
14:46
that they are also
14:49
doing working on so i'll also show you
14:51
so all those bits are hangs there
14:54
because they will be
14:56
used later in the afternoon
14:59
yeah
15:00
so
15:02
we are back and this is the fish now
15:05
they are
15:07
making cutting them and then they will
15:09
sun dry
15:10
them salt
15:12
and salt sorry and then sun dry them for
15:15
preservation so you can either sell them
15:18
or keep them for yourself but if you do
15:21
that
15:22
and you put salt they can take long
15:24
without going bad
15:41
and this is the boat that they are
15:42
apparent so this is how they repair a
15:44
boat
15:49
so it's upside down anyway
15:51
don't get confused the boat is upside
15:54
down and they are repairing it so that
15:56
it can work tomorrow and get some fish
16:00
for them so guys
16:02
we have come to the end of our video so
16:04
basically what's brutal here is to buy
16:06
this fish and here it is
16:10
