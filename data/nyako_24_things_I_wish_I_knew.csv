2:44
you whatever little thing i
2:46
know it's not easy like adulthood is a
2:49
come
2:49
like it says come
2:52
trust me it's not easy but then
2:56
for it we can move let's move anyway so
3:00
what do you have to do first uh i told
3:03
you guys like i'm not a financial
3:06
person now but i'm just sharing my
3:08
personal experience
3:10
how i budget how i manage my finance
3:14
yeah so you're planning to move out or
3:17
stay alone what do you
3:20
have to first do number one
3:24
get a job like do you have a job
3:29
get a job or any source of income like
3:32
you have to be having a source of income
3:36
trust me have a source of income you can
3:39
get a
3:40
job you can do marketing do promotions
3:43
do anything but
3:44
make sure don't leave your home like
3:46
your parents home
3:48
before you having a job otherwise are
3:51
going to manage to pay the bills
3:53
how it's hard
3:56
so make sure you have a job first before
3:59
you leave
4:01
yeah so when you get a job
4:04
then now you have to budget so when you
4:07
have a job
4:08
sale save your money and plan
4:11
so you have number two budget like move
4:14
to a place
4:15
under your budget to make sure where
4:16
you're moving
4:18
it's within or under your budget
4:21
otherwise
4:22
you just rent like for the first month
4:24
then you don't have money
4:25
understandably you have to go back to
4:27
your parents home which is not
4:29
what we would want you understand so
4:33
budget for your money budget for the
4:34
place do
4:36
um house search within your budget like
4:41
seriously like
4:42
me i had to first save
4:45
money save money like four months you're
4:49
staying in hostels saving money to get
4:52
my
4:53
own place understand so save your money
4:55
and then get a place
4:57
that is within your budget you
4:59
understand
5:00
yeah so you can get a bed seater like
5:03
one house one room yeah
5:06
and don't trash like oh i want to buy it
5:08
so long as you have a mattress
5:10
and you can sleep and you can cook your
5:13
food and the security is okay
5:15
don't mind about other things like don't
5:18
mind about fun sharing the place first
5:21
otherwise
5:22
you're going to use all your mind so
5:25
you're taking take your time to finish
5:27
your house take your time
5:29
take all the time you need trust me you
5:32
thank me later
5:33
take your time and then finish your
5:35
house at your own pace
5:37
don't rush don't compete with anyone
5:39
don't compare yourself with anyone
5:41
don't compare your house to anyone's
5:44
house that is
5:45
you you're the one staying there so
5:48
don't trash what's the ratio what's the
5:51
rush for
5:53
two days so you have to make sure that
5:57
you plan either your budgets for a week
6:00
two weeks or months but then i would
6:02
advise you to start
6:03
just start with the week i
6:06
just learn how much you're spending
6:10
every week then you
6:11
keep all the receipts whatever thing you
6:14
buy so
6:15
when you keep the receipt so happy for
6:17
don't trust
6:18
another thing you track every single
6:21
expenditure
6:22
like because this is like your first
6:24
time you don't know whatever
6:26
like what you need you don't know that
6:27
you have to buy a broom you don't know
6:29
what you have to buy this
6:31
so basically track all like every single
6:35
expedition
6:37
to be a point of reference for the next
6:40
month
6:40
you're going to know how much i spent
6:42
here but trust me like the first
6:45
month it's going to be like so cost full
6:48
it's going to be expensive but then
6:49
we're going to adjust with time
6:52
as long as you get what you need as i
6:54
told you what you need
6:55
first to the weekly
6:59
budgeting like are you going to because
7:01
i know like it's your first time so how
7:03
i i'm like i also struggle with this
7:06
like i don't know
7:07
i might buy things and thinking that for
7:10
one week then i just eat them within two
7:12
days
7:13
so you have to make sure that you plan
7:16
either
7:17
your budgets for a week two weeks or
7:19
months
7:20
but then i would advise you to start
7:22
just
7:23
start with the week i just
7:27
learn how much you're spending every
7:29
week then you
7:30
keep all the receipts whatever thing you
7:32
buy so
7:33
when you keep the receipt so happy for
7:35
that next month
7:36
to know how much you spend and what
7:38
things you spend
7:39
on so it will be like a point of
7:42
reference
7:43
okay keep all your receipts for your
7:46
friends
7:48
yeah so that's so then
7:51
budget so we are still under budget like
7:53
you have to budget for your bills know
7:55
how much is rent but
7:56
it is nice to and here you're going to
7:58
repair it like for the
8:00
first month you pay i mean for the first
8:02
moving
8:03
you pay three months of rent so
8:06
basically you have to pay with three
8:07
months rent
8:10
so you have to make sure that you you
8:12
have money for
8:13
power electricity bill and water bills
8:17
and um yeah i think those are the basics
8:20
that you have to have before you move
8:22
out
8:22
unless you move in to your own house
8:29
so if you have all the things then
8:32
you're able to figure out other things
8:34
on your own like trust the process like
8:37
everything will come into
8:40
position like trust the process so but
8:42
make sure you have this the water bill
8:45
electricity bill for like the first
8:47
three months if you want
8:49
to have like a peace of mind and then
8:51
you can
8:52
budget for other things then other
8:54
people like fear
8:55
to move out or to stay alone because
8:58
they think oh how am i going to be in an
9:00
empty house how am i going
9:02
i don't have this like cs don't first
9:04
mind about
9:06
organic like furniture material things
9:09
not mine about your well-being like are
9:11
you going to sleep you have a bed
9:13
like a mattress you understand some of
9:15
the things
9:16
then if you think that uh the rent is
9:19
high or you cannot manage you didn't get
9:21
a friend it's a romantic
9:24
i do call correcting like rent with
9:28
someone
9:28
there it will be easy but then whatever
9:32
comes with renting with someone is just
9:34
another issue but if you can
9:35
bear you're not good you can do that
9:40
because it's even easier so another
9:43
thing when you
9:44
budget you have to make sure you save
9:47
because you never know the future so
9:51
like i'm not talking as an expert in
9:53
surfing i also struggle like that's like
9:56
a very bad
9:59
what can i say um
10:04
character i really like i have it like
10:06
it's hard to say if you try
10:08
you'll be like i'm going to do this but
10:10
the only way you can save is like
10:11
budget and like okay when you get your
10:15
income the first thing you have to do is
10:16
to remove your savings like 10 percent
10:18
prison
10:19
remove the saving then you can join like
10:21
circles put that money in those circles
10:24
you understand
10:25
so it's like you don't access it yeah so
10:28
if you sell that money it's going to
10:29
help you if you then
10:31
don't you purchase whatever you don't
10:34
need
10:35
like like for the first five months
10:38
just do always whatever i don't need
10:40
don't purchase it
10:42
like the phantom things i don't need
10:44
this i don't need that right now
10:46
don't buy it just come you're going to
10:49
waste your money then you may need money
10:52
for something
10:53
very crucial and you don't have it so
10:56
don't you buy what you don't need
10:59
just focus on whatever you need only
11:02
just make life will be easier for you
11:05
and then another thing like
11:09
if you have bad saving ask ask your
11:12
friends like how do they do it there's
11:14
some friends that you have and they're
11:16
so
11:16
good that saving trust me they're so
11:19
good at saving
11:20
uh before you go on this
11:24
so you don't save everything and then
11:27
you forget about
11:28
living life because at the end of it all
11:31
we are here to live
11:32
life so if you're planning or you're
11:34
doing your budget make sure i have some
11:36
money
11:37
that you put aside for like your other
11:40
thing but let it just
11:41
be affordable you understand like
11:45
affordable so basically
11:49
i think that can work like
11:52
me i struggle with serving trust me
11:55
saving money it's not easy
11:57
because you might be having your company
11:59
you saved it you'd be like oh i don't
12:00
buy this oh i don't think and i i it's
12:03
like man they're going to eat outside
12:05
when i'm trying to leave it like i just
12:08
if i be like this month i'm going to eat
12:11
out
12:12
once or two times or three
12:15
and i do that that you'll eat like i
12:18
will not
12:18
go beyond that time i budgeted
12:21
for when i start so maybe you can also
12:24
try that
12:26
yeah but then it's not easy before
12:29
moving
12:30
out it's not really easy
12:33
but we are trying so i think that
12:37
that was the only thing that i had to
12:39
share with you guys
12:42
yeah we are trying so you just do
12:45
whatever you're doing
12:47
and leave other things to go and take
12:49
control over it
12:52
i'm not really good at the finance blah
12:55
blah blah
12:56
but then that's my thought that's i
12:58
think someone should trust budget
13:01
and they have to be having a job to move
13:04
out
13:05
and then you have to live within your
13:07
means
13:08
live within your means otherwise you are
13:11
doomed
13:13
don't compare yourself with others
13:15
because when you compare with yourself
13:17
you might be comparing their
13:18
middle struggle with your beginning and
13:22
you're just beginning in life you're
13:24
just setting up your life and you see
13:25
someone
13:26
is like doing whatever
13:30
you are going to do in 10 years and
13:32
you're just comparing yourself please
13:33
don't compare yourself
13:35
i appreciate whatever you have
13:38
and work with whatever you have within
13:40
your means
13:41
everything will be fine that's what i
13:43
think
13:44
