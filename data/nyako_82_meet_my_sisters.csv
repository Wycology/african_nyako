0:34
the like button and press the
0:35
notification bell so that every time i
0:38
post a video you're here to vibe with me
0:40
so you guys have been requesting that i
0:43
should bring other people in my channels
0:45
so here are my sisters they came from
0:47
another district but this is our home so
0:49
they came for
0:50
three days
0:51
then i requested them to make a video
0:54
with them because your request is my so
0:57
i have to tell them you guys come and do
0:59
it
1:00
and we make a video so we're going to
1:02
make it a fun video i'm going to ask
1:04
them questions would they rather do this
1:06
or not so this is
1:09
and this is
1:17
yeah yeah
1:21
so
1:22
i think without um
1:29
followers on instagram so we're going to
1:31
use our phone and we're using her phone
1:32
to record
1:34
so i'm going to take this advantage
1:35
where they are here to record many
1:37
videos
1:38
as we can so the first question
1:44
the first question is
1:46
would you rather go into the past and
1:49
meet your ancestors
1:51
or
1:52
go into the future and meet your great
1:54
great grandchildren of course the future
1:57
why i would love to meet my
1:58
grandchildren my best friend
2:01
but then you're going to go and you're
2:03
like 100 years then you're going to miss
2:05
these other years that you're remaining
2:08
no it doesn't matter it's fine
2:14
i think
2:15
the great branch
2:19
had anything to do with your ancestors
2:26
[Music]
2:31
would you rather have more time or more
2:34
money
2:45
i would rather have more time more time
2:47
and you don't have money yeah why
2:50
because
2:51
either way i'll survive
2:54
sometimes may i already have time i
2:56
would have for money
3:02
i don't have time yes i need more money
3:05
okay
3:07
would you rather be able to talk with
3:09
animals or
3:11
speak all foreign languages
3:15
animals
3:16
yes talking to animals
3:19
and you can't speak in a foreign
3:21
language but speaking my tribe is family
3:24
only yours and you don't know english
3:26
yes then i can translate what the
3:28
animals are saying
3:30
to people are you get money
3:33
and you i think i'd rather speak foreign
3:37
because i love traveling so i would love
3:39
to adventure you go to korea you sleep
3:41
there you go china
3:43
you go to spain
3:46
to animals
3:52
i know but there are the people who
3:53
speak foreign languages so you will be
3:55
yeah okay that makes sense so another
3:58
one
3:59
would you rather win the lottery or live
4:02
twice as long
4:04
like if you're going to live for only 50
4:05
years you live 100 years oh wait a
4:07
little time
4:08
yeah
4:10
wait because all right i'm going to live
4:11
that long
4:13
that long so i don't want
4:16
yeah
4:21
okay
4:23
would you feel worse
4:25
if no one showed up
4:27
this is interesting would you feel worse
4:30
if no one showed up
4:32
at your wedding
4:33
or to your funeral like would you feel
4:36
what no one shows up at your wedding oh
4:38
yeah would you feel worse if no one
4:40
shows up at your finger
4:53
for me
4:55
i'd feel bad
4:57
if they don't attend if they
5:00
[Music]
5:01
okay i wouldn't feel bad if they didn't
5:03
attend my wedding because i want few
5:05
people anyway but they can't come for my
5:07
barrier i would
5:16
so for the african traditional setting
5:18
you rather turn someone's finger then
5:20
they are waiting so note that if you're
5:22
an african you have to attend someone's
5:24
funeral if you don't attend they mark
5:26
you as a bad person in the community
5:29
yeah so
5:30
would you rather be without internet for
5:33
a week or without your phone
5:36
for a week i think without internet
5:38
without it i'll do it without internet
5:40
me too
5:51
no when you don't have even this one but
5:53
you said when i can make phones you
5:54
can't have your phone but you don't yeah
5:56
without doubt
5:57
so you can rather be without internet
5:59
yes
6:01
yeah you are in love with your phone you
6:03
can't do it come on
6:17
[Music]
6:25
okay
6:26
would you rather meet george washington
6:29
or the current president the that guy on
6:31
the dollar sign no i don't know them the
6:34
president of the u.s
6:36
the president of the u.s i would rather
6:38
meet remember you can't either you meet
6:40
the character
6:41
mandela
6:47
[Laughter]
6:59
would you rather lose your vision or
7:01
your hair
7:02
[Music]
7:03
oh yeah what's hair on my hair
7:06
oh god that's a hard one no
7:08
i'd rather lose my hearing
7:11
so that you can feel
7:13
me
7:14
lose my hair
7:18
so that you can still see people and you
7:20
talk and you can read someone's lips
7:23
you can read someone's lips and you can
7:25
learn some yeah yeah
7:29
would you rather work more hours per day
7:33
but fewer days of work
7:37
per day or
7:39
few hours per day but more days like
7:42
would you rather work more hours
7:44
per day
7:47
or work less hours but
7:50
more days
7:51
i don't know if i think yes i understand
7:53
like you work for
7:54
four hours but to two weeks two weeks oh
7:57
you work for eight hours one week one
7:59
week
7:59
no i think i would rather stretch it too
8:02
to a longer time yeah all right
8:06
time because then i have time to do my
8:10
other stuff and
8:13
okay so this way
8:15
would you rather listen to music from
8:18
the 70s or music from today
8:21
i know the cervantes was but they had
8:24
better music i think
8:26
i would rather listen to music of today
8:28
by the way
8:30
oh by the way i'm uh 80s
8:36
now i would rather listen to music from
8:38
today
8:40
and that's what i like
8:42
another
8:45
would you rather become
8:47
someone someone else or just tell you if
8:50
you haven't like you can become someone
8:53
else in this world
8:55
if you have that chance of becoming
8:56
someone else
8:58
like can you or you can oh you would
9:01
rather stay you
9:03
can become
9:04
president's daughter
9:10
[Laughter]
9:17
because this is it for you
9:19
for you you already know your problems
9:21
but there's people you don't know
9:24
yeah but sometimes
9:26
you see sometimes i wish
9:28
or maybe i even think
9:31
maybe one day
9:33
someone will say
9:35
that life you're living
9:38
no that life you're living
9:40
isn't was just to make you laugh
9:42
but this is your real life
9:45
you may be a rich man's daughter
9:51
[Music]
9:59
that makes sense
10:04
okay would you rather be batman or
10:06
spiderman so this is for people who
10:08
watch cartoons none of those animations
10:10
but man
10:11
that's why that's why i mean like
10:13
rescues people that's it yeah absolutely
10:15
even batman yeah even
10:30
but would you rather be stuck on a
10:34
broken
10:35
skate you know this one is not that okay
10:38
would you
10:39
this one is either oh
10:44
can if they give you
10:47
free ticket air tickets internationally
10:50
or
10:52
go to everywhere you want like just
10:55
within the country unlimited trip within
10:57
the country
11:01

11:03
restaurant
11:05

11:09
a plane ticket once a year
11:11
to any destination you want a plane
11:14
