2:33
i'm going to show you everything
2:35
in my kitchen anyway and that is a
2:39
charcoal stove
2:41
and these are calveras
2:44
this is our cooking stones also
2:46
preserved in case we are we're having a
2:49
party or we have a lot of things to cook
2:53
we can use them
2:55
and this is our butter
2:57
and our piston i think you know what
2:59
this is you people this one
3:02
this is for this understand for our
3:05
spices but we have a bigger one
3:09
so this is the bigger one
3:12
you see
3:14
[Music]
3:17
so this is the big one you see
3:20
and this is how we use it we put in our
3:22
cassava
3:24
and then we can pound i don't want to
3:26
pound i don't want to pound because
3:28
there's nothing in it
3:30
yum
3:31
and this will take us to your people i'm
3:34
not going to carry this grounding sponge
3:37
okay let me carry it for you guys
3:40
so this is our grounding sun
3:42
grinding stone
3:47
but
3:48
they use the grain black charcoal
3:52
so this is what you get this is a small
3:54
one and you do this
3:57
and then you can grind understand this
4:00
is our brain
4:02
i think i'll make a video grinding our
4:05
nuts groundnuts or simpson whatever
4:09
we'll be there to be grinding okay let
4:11
me put this back let me put it but it's
4:15
really heavy like heavy it's not for
4:18
joking
4:21
and
4:22
this is our flower cassava flour
4:25
if you saw my video making food this is
4:28
the flour
4:29
that we use to make
4:32
our food so this basically they get
4:34
cassava in it
4:36
they get cassava and then they grind it
4:39
to this flour and then you mingle
4:44
so this one is a basket
4:47
comment below if you guys also have
4:49
baskets like this in your village please
4:51
let me know
4:53
and what do you use them for so for us
4:55
this basket
4:57
we use them to carry our food from the
4:59
garden
5:01
like this nutella you're doing it
5:04
so this is how we carry our food i don't
5:07
have that thing that makes it stay on
5:10
the head that's why so this is how we
5:12
carry this
5:14
yeah and this is our jericho so this is
5:17
always in the kitchen already already in
5:19
the kitchen
5:21
and this is our firewood
5:23
actually we have run out of firewood
5:29
so we have run now to firewood
5:34
we have few firewood
5:36
left and then this is still our flower
5:40
kept you guys sensing
5:43
we still have flour
5:46
firewood
5:47
and this is that got skin
5:50
for sitting on when you're here
5:55
i think that's all
5:58

6:01
that's our roof so basically that's what
6:03
you do you
6:05
tea is ready so i'm going to first make
6:08

6:12

6:14
to face some water i'm going to get one
6:16
jelly kind of water i think i should
6:18
take you guys along and you see how we
6:20
carry water home
6:27
hey guys i'm going to get water
6:30
um then i can come
6:32
i've already washed the plates
6:36
and the saucepan everything is clean so
6:38
let me get some water quick and we
6:40
continue our day
6:54
so you guys
6:56
i didn't video when i was at that well
6:59
so
7:01
here we are
7:02
i've come back
7:04
with our train trip this is 20 liter
7:06
jerry fans
7:08
so
7:09
um
7:10
i've just approached home
7:12
as you can see
7:14
but the place is very far where we get
7:17
our water from nigeria
7:19
it's very fast
7:22
right i had to get water because you
7:24
need it
7:32
so you guys we are here back
7:36
i'm tired that's why i'm not even
7:38
holding
7:42
it
7:56
[Applause]
7:57
i finally come back home
8:00
i'm tired but i have nothing to do it's
8:02
not an empty jericho and it has water so
8:05
i have to put it off my head now
8:07
and i continue with my work
8:14
ah
8:16
so this one
8:18
this is called
8:20
or touch in my language this is what you
8:22
do
8:24
and then you put it on your head
8:26
to protect the girlfriend from
8:29
squeezing your head so that's what i did
8:32
but
8:32
surely this is what a 20 liter jericho
8:36
it's full
8:37
it's not that i'm joking you understand
8:39
it's full so i'm going to take it inside
8:48
sorry guys i'm going to check on the
8:50
gods come this is what i do every
8:52
morning
8:54
did i show you that this is where we put
8:55
our plates before i go yes let's use our
8:58
suspense buy them
9:01
and this is a very huge suspect because
9:03
we are very big family so
9:17
so this is where our bodies live but
9:19
then some of them
9:21
are already taken to grace
9:23
yeah
9:24
so they are here this one is pregnant so
9:27
we are expecting babies soon
9:30
and this one also
9:32
here
9:33
i don't want to disturb them
9:36
and this one is also chilling here and i
9:38
miss one i don't know what she's looking
9:40
for here
9:42
i don't know
9:43
so
9:45
this is where they go trip so we are
9:47
going to take them to grace but i don't
9:50
know if because i cannot hold the camera
9:52
we cannot hold the camera and then we
9:54
check them so we're just going to take
9:56
them but i've showed you guys
9:58
yeah and this is where they put their
10:00
feeds like if you want to feed them you
10:02
put it here but then they have eaten
10:04
everything now
10:06
everything you can show you behind there
10:09
we have a mini garden there
10:11
there's our bananas
10:13
and then our purple tree it's there that
10:16
one is a purple tree
10:18
yeah maybe you can have a mini tour
10:20
there also
10:30
so guys
10:34
this is this is our purpose i've showed
10:36
you five but i think this one has pests
10:38
on it let me show you this one
10:40
that is healthy
10:42
this side
10:43
i don't want to touch them because i
10:45
might
10:46
give them a disease so this and then the
10:50
other ones also you can see that
10:53
but then
10:54
