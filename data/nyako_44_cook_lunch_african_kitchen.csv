0:31
you've been watching my previous videos
0:32
so you know this is our kitchen yeah we
0:34
don't have a sink we don't have white
0:36
but this is the kitchen
0:38
so this is our stuffed cooking stove
0:41
it's called the sigiri osha
0:44
and this is what we are having for lunch
0:47
you'll be wondering what is this this is
0:49
fish
0:50
so we have different types of fish there
0:52
is this type i don't know how it's
0:54
called
0:55
i'm not good at telling you these types
0:57
in english because i only know them in
0:59
my language and then we have this
1:03
and we have this also
1:08
and then we have this
1:11
so you guys
1:13
uh let me put it here
1:17
because now i have to wash them and we
1:18
have this little these ones oh it has
1:21
spritzed me
1:23
so all this puzzle you guys has pricked
1:25
me
1:26
anyway this one this is not young fish
1:28
it's an old fish by the way but there
1:31
this is their size
1:34
welcome my name is
1:40
[Music]
2:09
so i have to
2:11
clean them
2:12
so this one it has that yield the
2:15
skulls
2:18
scale scales yeah so i have to remove
2:21
this
2:24
so this one that they don't remove the
2:26
skill so what you have to do is to
2:27
remove the intestines
2:37
so these are the intestines
2:47
so this is how you have to clean that
2:49
fish
2:51
actually in my village you always eat
2:53
fish because we have the river now so
2:56
people always do fishing there
3:14
so i have to make sure i wash the gills
3:16
also here
3:19
like this
3:26
then you cut it like this make sure it's
3:29
clean because you don't have to use
3:30
something that is not clean
3:33
that is ready
3:42
and this moment
3:51
this one also
4:01
really going to get on this and for
4:02
yourselves
4:14
there you have this one
4:20
okay
4:29
you have to cut them into pieces or they
4:31
can fit in the saucepan
4:34
and even eating them easier when they
4:37
are cut
4:41
two pieces
4:58
citizens they might look like they are
5:01
small but they are big fish this is like
5:03
a mother fish you look at it
5:08
oh it doesn't bite you guys
5:10
hope he doesn't bite and it's on his
5:12
side this one looks like a shark
5:16
look at it
5:18
let me stop playing with the food
5:21
poison
5:22
it started
5:25
this is onions
5:26
and these are our tomatoes that you are
5:28
going to use to fry
5:31
to fry this
5:33
posing
5:35
hey guys everything is set
5:38
our onions as i've told you
5:41
tomatoes tomatoes
5:45
cooking oil
5:54
so when you put your onions
5:56
then you get ready to put your tomatoes
5:59
these are tomatoes
6:03
tomato
6:05
so those are our tomatoes and then these
6:07
are snacks that we had for
6:09
uh breakfast
6:12
boiled maize
6:14
and this is a fish we are going to
6:16
this is very good you guys cook using
6:18
rico if yes let me know
6:22
in the comment section below
6:30
so here
6:32
our onions are now golden
6:34
golden fried then you
6:38
add your tomatoes
6:43
this is our mingling stick
7:00
first we don't measure so you just put
7:02
until your ancestor tell you please
7:05
stop
7:06
if you don't hear your ancestors telling
7:08
you to stop you don't have to stop if
7:10
the time you stop then you stop you have
7:12
to measure anything your ancestors will
7:15
always guide you on how to make it
7:17
so mine have told me to add a little bit
7:25
so after making your gravy you add water
7:29
and then you add your fish
7:31
as you can see here
7:35
so this is
7:37
our sauce
7:39
made pima come on
7:49
and then you have to add more
8:04
so i'm going to use this to cover our
8:06
food so that it can cook well
8:10
there you go leave it for some minutes
8:12
after like 25 minutes and then it's
8:15
ready see you when we are making for
8:18
sure
8:22
[Music]
8:35
so we are going to make our food there
8:37
then
8:38
actually i think i should show you guys
8:40

guys when i'm serving maybe

9:18

9:19
so when the water boils you add in your
9:23
flour
9:25
like that
9:27
and then
9:28
you get your mingling stick
9:35
and you get this this is the one we used
9:37
to bring
9:39
so make sure the water is boiled
9:41
otherwise
9:42
you will eat food that is not
9:45
