2:12
how much do you have like to start your
2:14
business it doesn't matter trust me it
2:16
doesn't matter how much you have
2:18
as long as you have some money plan
2:20
towards that money
2:22
and use it well so with ten thousand all
2:24
this you can start a very profitable
2:26
business
2:26
in uganda anywhere anywhere in uganda
2:29
you can start a
2:30
very profitable business
2:34
so and then with mo mocap you can
2:36
venture into bigger businesses right
2:39
yeah you can just comment below there if
2:42
you can if you think you can't then just
2:44
sit there and then
2:46
let me tell you how you're going to do
2:48
that
2:49
so business number one like business
2:51
idea number one
2:53
what do you think you can invest in in
2:56
uganda
2:56
you're gonna be in a developing country
3:00
it's just developing
3:02
so there's no much to do with the
3:06
food processing people just get their
3:08
food how it is and any
3:10
problems yeah
3:14
so for them
3:17
for the food processing because of
3:21
us not having a lot of food processing
3:24
industry that's also business because
3:26
when they're still growing so you can
3:27
really
3:28
venture into that part of the business
3:31
there are a lot of opportunities so the
3:33
demand for the quality food is
3:35
increasing with the
3:36
growing population especially the urban
3:39
areas of chicano that is kapalam
3:42
um and uh
3:47
interview so basically that's what you
3:50
have to base
3:50
on to have a business idea you
3:52
understand
3:55
are we together so if you have capital
3:57
you can start a food processing business
4:00
that offers value added processed foods
4:03
like um you can start fruits vegetables
4:08
or nuts like
4:11
nuts or sears oh serious it's been but
4:14
then you can get them you can get like
4:15
grains
4:16
let me say in northern part of uganda in
4:19
some parts of uganda they
4:20
grow a lot of rice but trust me
4:24
people still and you're gonna exp like
4:26
import rice from pakistan you understand
4:29
that if you can do it here why not
4:31
like why not you have your capital you
4:34
understand you can just start getting
4:37
the rice from eastern part of yogurt and
4:39
it's cheaper by the way
4:40
last time i bought 10 kilograms of rice
4:43
after
4:44
25 000 imagine imagine
4:49
that's very cheap so if you can really
4:51
do your processing you pack them well
4:54
brand them you're good to go you're
4:55
going to become a millionaire
4:57
don't ask me why i'm not a millionaire
4:59
because i'm in the process of becoming
5:00
one
5:03
yes so that's that's our first
5:07
first business idea so think about it
5:10
then the second business idea the second
5:12
one number two
5:13
what do you want to invest in real
5:15
estate can't you
5:17
get something like if you have money by
5:19
knowing what you have to do
5:20
buy land build houses
5:24
they can be like rentals
5:27
or you can't build houses where they can
5:30
lease them
5:31
so for the real estate this is another
5:33
booming sector
5:35
in uk that investors can explore
5:38
like if you want to just start putting
5:40
your money and getting
5:42
back within few years trust me just get
5:45
lucky because they still
5:46
just land around kampala like
5:50
mekong interim um
5:54
where exactly actually i will do a video
5:57
about that too
5:58
but there are a lot of places just
6:00
nearby
6:02
a nearby kampala with nice land and you
6:04
can
6:05
really invest in that buy london super
6:08
price
6:08
build sell the houses out
6:12
like like what are you waiting for
6:16
like what are you waiting for anyway so
6:19
that's another business
6:20
think about it think about it
6:23
you have money and you're nervous that
6:25
you want to invest
6:27
think about it and you can tell me in
6:30
the comments below
6:31
to help you out why because i'm a
6:34
business woman
6:35
anyway another business still it's
6:39
like it's like that but it's also
6:42
it comes into touring like so this
6:46
uh what i had in my mind about this
6:48
business
6:49
is like uganda is one of the most
6:51
visited
6:53
vacation destinations in africa by the
6:56
way
6:57
hence it plays host to
7:01
most of visitors annually
7:05
so here there are opportunities for
7:07
airbnb business like a
7:09
better breakfast business just you can
7:12
by the way i have a good
7:13
idea about this if you cannot afford the
7:17
house
7:18
to make an airbnb you don't have like to
7:21
get a house
7:22
and then you would know you can even get
7:25
your money
7:26
and rent a whole flat then furnish it as
7:30
long as you make
7:30
agreements with the owner the landlord
7:32
or the landlady
7:34
and then you put it in writing because
7:36
those people sometimes can be
7:37
tricky when you start making money
7:40
they'll be like oh
7:41
how come i didn't have this idea maybe i
7:43
can send off this password then i can
7:45
do the same business so they're really
7:47
petty
7:48
so you have to make sure you have your
7:49
lawyer and you do everything
7:52
retain and document it so that you have
7:55
reference in case anything goes bad
7:57
but it's a great idea but before i pay
8:00
me for giving you all this knowledge
8:02
just subscribe to my channel for more
8:04
business ideas trust me i'm going to
8:07
give you a lot of knowledge in this head
8:12
anyway so you can set up that airbnb
8:17
so it will work actually it can't work
8:19
in any part of uganda
8:20
because it's important we've got a lot
8:22
of touring destination
8:24
northern part of uganda yeah and then
8:26
there is pop quiet oh my god if you want
8:29
to invest in buckwheat please contact me
8:31
i'm going to tell you how
8:33
you can even build a resort there it's
8:35
near to the
8:36
biggest national park in uganda
8:40
i don't know if it's the biggest other
8:42
second so far it's me there
8:44
but it's so like 30 minutes from
8:47
the national park and um it's really
8:51
a fudging place like no much investments
8:54
going on people have just started so
8:56
the earlier the better you understand a
8:59
little bit
9:00
yeah so you can do that let's go to our
9:05
business idea number three number three
9:08
number number four
9:10
so you can set up a result also yeah
9:13
most results are located down near the
9:17
gamepad of dishes named terry
9:21
but then you can do that because you
9:23
can't
9:24
my dear people here love life
9:28
so if you can invest in that
9:31
you're good to go you're good to go
9:33
you're good to go
9:34
another thing
9:41
another thing is um transport system
9:44
like if you can
9:45
buy cars and make like hire them out
9:48
people for moving around touring
9:52
or we can um get away with if people
9:56
want to go like to another district just
9:58
give them those cars
10:00
like seriously getting money money
10:07
[Music]
10:12
we really do match in the rolo part of
10:16
uganda
10:17
so ugandans are becoming more aware of
10:20
the advantages
10:21
of solar energy
10:24
so there are bigger opportunities for
10:26
businesses that offer solar
10:29
panels installments and those that sell
10:32
solar
10:33
power accessories so if you can venture
10:35
into that kind of business
10:37
also trust me you'll be like
10:40
this you'll be our next bill gates you
10:44
understand
10:45
me i don't have capital that's why i'm
10:47
giving you ideas
10:49
so another thing the seventh
10:52
business idea do you want to know it
10:56
actually for this idea or even i'm going
10:59
to
10:59
put a photo there and you see for
11:02
construction it's like
11:03
if you can have money you have to
11:07
venture into construction trust me due
11:10
to the rapid increasing number of the
11:12
new buildings and constructions in
11:14
uganda there is a demand for
11:16
construction
11:17
prod products and services
11:20
so either you have like a company that
11:23
provides some
11:25
engineers like these constructors to
11:29
people and construct
11:30
or you sell products
11:33
for construction so it will depend on
11:36
what
11:37
how much you can afford and how much
11:40
capital you have so you can
11:42
do that so you can start a business
11:44
that's so
11:45
cement blocks breaks that's a business
11:49
that
11:50
pleases construction machines such as
11:52
the concrete mixture i don't know that
11:54
thing
11:55
you can have like those machines because
11:57
people can come
11:58
and hire them but because some people
12:00
prefer making their own breaks like they
12:02
get
12:03
cement and whatever then they do their
12:05
own bricks from their
12:07
site where they are going to build the
12:10
house from
12:10
me when i get mad that's what i'm going
12:12
to do
12:14
making bricks those big big bricks
12:17
because now it's because most people
12:19
construct using them
12:21
not this clear one but the one that they
12:24
use send me sand
12:25
and swimming yeah so
12:29
hope you give me a like for all these
12:31
business ideas
12:33
you're not paying me so the only way you
12:36
can pay me
12:38
is to is to give me a like
12:44
