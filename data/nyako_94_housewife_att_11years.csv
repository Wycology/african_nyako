0:06
life
0:07
cayenne is 11 year old girl
0:11
living here in the village in a small
0:13
village park
0:15
this is where she stays and here she is
0:17
with a big smile because i'm going to be
0:19

0:22

0:25

0:28

0:33
so cayenne is just 11 years old but what
0:36
she does during the day will wow you out
0:40
so let's
0:41
go into this video and see what she does
0:45
here we go please enjoy
0:49
[Music]
0:59
well
1:15
disclaimer before i start this video
1:17
this is no child labor in any form
1:21
and i want to inform you that this is
1:25
not child abuse
1:28
basically this is what every 11 year old
1:31
in my village does
1:33
willingly and enjoying their work at
1:36
home i personally did this with them
1:38
when when i was living and i had no
1:41
problem with it
1:42
so this being a dry season and no one is
1:45
going to school kayen wakes up at 7 30
1:49
in the morning
1:51
and this is where she sleeps in the
1:53
kitchen at the same time it's her
1:55
bedroom
1:56
so most kids
1:58
here in my village sleep in the kitchen
2:01
and their parents sleep in another heart
2:03
cause like that
2:04
our houses don't have like rooms it's
2:06
only one house so you just have to build
2:09
multiple
2:10
houses for them to sleep in so
2:14
the young girls like this
2:16
sleep in the
2:18
kitchen so basically when you wake up in
2:20
the morning what you have to do is to
2:22
get your bedding
2:23
out
2:24
and
2:26
put it
2:27
against the heart for it to hear it so
2:31
this is what she was doing that's her
2:33
blanket
2:35
the papyrus mat
2:38
so
2:39
after doing that we shall see what
2:41
cayenne is doing next
2:43
she gets a cup of water and then
2:47
washes her face
2:49
so because we don't like she doesn't
2:51
have a toothbrush so what she does is
2:54
she use a stick to brush a teeth but not
2:57
every day she does it like
2:59
every after a day so maybe today that
3:01
wasn't a day for brushing so here she
3:04
cleans a saucepan to put in water for
3:06
tea and then straight goes into the
3:09
kitchen to light up the fire
3:12
this being a dry season we don't go to
3:15
the garden every day we only go to
3:17
harvest and we come back immediately so
3:20
she remains at home and make breakfast
3:23
for people that have gone to do that
3:25
harvesting of crops
3:27
so they have to come back after like
3:29
three hours and find when tea is ready
3:33
so guys here she's trying to
3:37
light the fire so she can put um
3:41
water 40 in the morning
3:47
so those are the firewoods
3:54
and trust me she knows what she's doing
3:57
because she has been doing
3:59
doing this for years did i say doing
4:09
so she has already lit the fire over
4:11
light light the fire now she has put the
4:15
tea
4:17
and then
4:19
let's see what she'll do
4:26
next so she has to clean the kitchen
4:30
stroke bedroom this is the same room
4:32
that she sleeps in
4:35
and
4:37
this is the same room that is location
4:40
see there as you can see
4:45
and from the tender edge we are taught
4:47
by our parents that you can never cook
4:50
in the kitchen when it's dirty first
4:52
clean the kitchen and make sure the
4:54
environment you're cooking in is clean
4:56
and safe
4:57
for your health
4:59
so cairne seemed to have understood the
5:02
assignment that her parents taught her
5:05
and here she cleans the kitchen and even
5:08
sweeps the compound
5:10
before she heads to the stream
5:14
to get some water
5:18
comment below if an 11 year old also
5:21
does this in your village please let me
5:24
know
5:25
and if you have not yet subscribed to my
5:26
channel please take this opportunity to
5:28
subscribe so that you don't miss a lot
5:30
that is coming in
5:34
so we always dump the rubbish just
5:36
nearby there is a pit there to use
5:39
sometimes back to
5:41
lay bricks or to make bricks but then we
5:44
dump there our rubbish and then we can
5:48
and then we can burn it some
5:50
days afterwards when it's dry all so
5:54
cayenne is done
5:56
with lighting the fire putting
5:59
water for tea and even sweeping the
6:01
house so let's see what is next
6:10
so what's next
6:12
i think now she's going to wash plates
6:14
so she has to get them from inside
6:18
and take them outside let's wait for her
6:21
to come back
6:22
so basically this is what
6:24
she does every day like seriously this
6:27
is her morning routine without filtering
6:30
without anything without cutting
6:33
this is what she does every day
6:40
so cayenne gets the utensils out ready
6:43
to be watched so basically why is she
6:45
washing utensils in the morning we have
6:47
our supper at around
6:51
6 30 or 7 00
6:54
p.m in the evening but we don't wash the
6:57
plates immediately we don't wash the
6:59
utensils we always keep them for the
7:01
next day there's no power in my village
7:04
so people tend to sleep so early or
7:07
just tell stories before they go to bed
7:09
and then they finally sleep but we don't
7:12
really do our utensils at night we have
7:14
to wait
7:15
for them like we have to keep them and
7:17
then wash them in the next day in the
7:20
morning
7:23
i think the fire it's taking long to
7:26
light
7:28
such as to keep on blowing
7:33
finally it lights up
7:38
[Music]
7:43
there's the chicken making for us noise
8:10
ah marketing
8:13
[Music]
8:20
so kane is really active
8:22
young girl
8:24
and talkative but because
8:27
because now i think she's going with
8:29
fresh water yeah but then you people i
8:31
will not go back to the stream
8:34
because i have things
8:36
but let's go so i'm going to leave her
8:38
to go then i'll video her when she's
8:40
back let's see if she's going to come
8:42
back with water
8:52
bye so uh age cayenne and buy a carriage
8:56
a 20 litre jersey why do you have water
8:59
i don't know if it's a culture but when
9:01
you're ten years and you don't carry 20
9:04
liter jericho
9:05
finish other kids
9:07
will always learn
9:08
so we tend to practice
9:12
by the time we turn eight
9:14
we can already carry 20 liter jericho as
9:17
you can see the kids at the background
9:20
two of them have 20 liters and the other
9:23
ones where like six years they have ten
9:25
but you can't put that directly down no
9:27
more it might be going to help
9:30
but
9:41
[Music]
9:46
so i think now she's going to wash her
9:49
utensils so i'm going to leave you guys
9:51
there
9:52
then i'll continue when she's on another
9:54
activity
10:01
[Applause]
10:01
[Music]
10:15
uh
10:19
so guys comment below if an 11 year old
10:22
in your village or your town anywhere
10:25
where you live can do what cayenne is
10:28
doing
10:29
and um
10:30
i'll not get tired
10:32
telling you that you should subscribe
10:34
cause
10:36
because you should subscribe hit that
10:38
like button for me and press the
10:40
notification bell so that you don't miss
10:42
out on any video on this channel
10:45
let's grow together
10:58
what is common with many african videos
11:01
that i watch when you're watching plates
11:03
in the morning these birds can always
11:05
come so they can
11:07
get on the leftovers around so that they
11:10
can also feed on them so
11:13
but then that's the reason we do
11:16
dry our plates or utensils up on the
11:19
utensils to stand
11:21
so that they cannot reach there once you
11:24
wash your utensils you have to make sure
11:26
they are clean and safe from any bed or
11:29
animals around the home
11:32
so we keep them up there as you will see
11:34
cain also
11:36
puts the utensils up the utensil stand
11:40
when she's done washing them all
11:43
well so those are the suspense guys i
11:46
told you why i also spun a duck behind
11:49
like on the outer side and
11:51
inside it's all okay because we use
11:53
firewood to cook so basically that's the
11:56
reason
12:02
[Music]
12:45
good driver
13:25
so
13:40
you guys this is so sparkling did you
13:42
see that kettle before and then this is
13:44
after
14:00
this is where she was hungry
14:09
so she's done
14:11
with washing the utensils sweeping the
14:14
compound flipping the house
14:17
so there's our way that's the utensils
14:20
talking about all the things
14:22
has already washed so it has to keep
14:24
them there so that they are safe and
14:26
clean
14:27
for home years so she wants to show you
14:31
guys those are the mingling sticks gunko
14:34
foreign
14:35
[Laughter]
14:39
so i was telling her to smile
14:42
still
14:43
preparing breakfast
14:45
and then from breakfast she has to
14:46
prepare lunch and then dinner
14:49
trust me she does a lot of work
14:52
throughout the day but for this video
14:54
let's stop here this is our morning
14:57
routine
14:59
so here we are for lunch i didn't i i
15:02
wasn't at home to capture everything but
15:05
now she prepared lunch you guys will be
15:08
seeing and now she's making posh
15:10
show
15:12
it's making pressure
15:18
there's a lot of wind i think i should
15:20
enter
15:26
so i told you people always eat that
15:28
brown portion that is cassava flour so
15:31
in my language it's called quinongora
15:33
meaning that
15:35
food that is made from cassava flour so
15:38
that is it i hope you've seen that in
15:41
many of my videos
15:43
that's our step of food and as being the
15:46
people from the river the journal we eat
15:48
it with fish
15:50
or small fish the silver fish anything
15:52
but i think today she's having it with
15:54
silver fish and some beans
15:58
so that's cayenne for you
16:04
i was telling her to look at the camera
16:06
just a little bit and you can proceed
16:14
so to train a kid out to make this
16:16
posture basically they start when they
16:18
are like eight years old and they can
16:20
start by only making like one cup of
16:23
water for only like
16:25
themselves and the kids that at home
16:28
like the kids below four years so that
16:30
they can learn they practice
16:33
then with time practice can make perfect
16:36
then they are
16:37
able to make food to mingle posture that
16:40
is enough for the whole family so during
16:43
there we are really like few number of
16:45
people at home because some of them have
16:47
gone to the garden so she's able to make
16:49
food like for six people and that's what
16:51
she has done today
17:07
if you have ever been in focus you know
17:09
it's very hot you can't see she's even
17:10
sweating
17:12
like pakoras is literally the hottest
17:14
district in uganda like without doubt
17:17
i've been to gulu but akash is like very
17:20
hot
17:22
so during december
17:25
we sleep outside in january maybe you
17:27
guys will make a video for you when we
17:28
are sleeping outside we do literally
17:30
sleep outside because it's very hot they
17:33
hit inside the house you cannot handle
17:35
it
17:35
in late december and early january
17:39
so she has to warm that
17:41
sauce because she had prepared it before
17:43
making the bushes so
17:45
just to warn me that's what she's doing
17:54
by the way kaine goes to school but
17:56
because of kovi they have been at home
17:58
for two years but she's in primary three
18:01
she would have been in primary five by
18:04
now yeah
18:05
but she goes to a local primary school
18:08
just in my village here i'll show you
18:10
the school song by the way
18:14
without doubt she can do everything at
18:16
home actually i didn't finish like all
18:19
her activities during the day but
18:22
trust me she does a lot she does a lot
18:26
which is applying to every trilobia 13
18:30
11 10 15 in my village and they're okay
18:35
with it
18:36
so here she serves the silver fish in
18:39
one big bowl that one is for elder
18:41
people
18:42
or big people and then the plastic
18:45
plates they are for the kids basically
18:47
today that that one will be for the twin
18:50
and the other one for the other twin and
18:52
the other one will be for the other
18:55
young boy i think you've seen him in the
18:57
video is much younger than the twins
19:14
so
19:33
those are beans the one she's putting
19:35
there and this is a silver fish
19:39
oh omena omokene
19:42
so in our village this is for
19:45
big people and the other needs for kids
19:47
so the kids eat separate and then the
19:49
big people will eat all together there
19:56
so that's the served food
19:59
ready
20:01
see you i'm not going to show you guys
20:03
when they are eating i don't think
20:04
that's proper for them they'll be shy
20:07
cayenne
20:08
thank you
20:10
hi
20:15
bye bye
