hey guys welcome back to my youtube
0:03
channel
0:04
so today we are going to make a ugali
0:06
that's how we call it in kenya in uganda
0:08
we call it
0:09
porsche so basically portion now before
0:14
we go into this please
0:15
subscribe to my channel i bet subscribe
0:18
give me a thumbs up and hit the
0:21
notification
0:22
bell so that every time i upload a video
0:25
you can get to watch it first anyway
0:28
let's proceed so in a way to make
0:31
pressure
0:32
you have to have boiled water or you can
0:34
boil the water in your pan
0:37
like this just put your water
0:40
boil water or boil it from that pan for
0:42
me i already have my
0:44
water here 100 degrees
0:54
so when you put the water that's enough
1:00
that's step one get your boiled water
1:04
put it in the pan make sure it's really
1:07
boiled because if
1:08
it's not boiled if it's half boiled that
1:10
pressure will not get ready
1:12
so then step two get that portion
1:18
this is maize flower
1:23
mangano uganda so by
1:26
where you got that beautiful
1:31
so put the potion in the boiled water
1:42
and that's enough so this is how it
1:46
looks
1:47
then get your mingling stick i don't
1:50
know how
1:51
people put it in your language
2:00
let's start mingling
2:15
so this is how you've been mingling your
2:17
portion
2:19
make sure you mingle all the sides
2:26
like this turn it
2:44
so you give it some time
2:48
if you have something to cover your
2:50
satisfied with
2:52
make sure you cover it so let the vapor
2:58
cook it can cook down yeah
3:01
so you can leave it for like two minutes
3:05
or one minute it depends on how like the
3:08
quantity of what you're making
3:13
so we are waiting so yeah it's like
3:15
steaming and cooking
3:27
continue mingling the portion
3:38
you have to make sure all the flour
3:44
dissolves
4:12
is
4:20
so it takes about
4:24
five minutes to make this small
4:28
portion but if you're making potions and
4:31
um so this question is like for two
4:33
people you're making like
4:34
five people or you're making one kg of
4:37
love
4:38
to really need a lot of energy it needs
4:41
a lot of
4:42
energy but then this one is a small
4:46
portion of only two people oh one person
4:49
depends on how much you eat
4:53
so the only way to know that question is
4:55
ready
4:59
it will stop like it will detach itself
5:02
from that saucepan
5:04
so here you can see our portion
5:08
is ready
5:14
yeah now i'm going to serve it
5:28
[Music]
5:31
is ready here we go
5:40
and we have this thing i don't know how
5:42
it's called in english
5:45
this thing here i don't know how it's
5:47
called in english but it's like a
5:48
chapati you can also eat it before you
5:50
eat the portion
5:52
that's the rule the rule for that
5:54
question is first eat this one
5:56
then you have it and this one is the
5:58
person who has made oh i've made that
5:59
portion
6:02
so this is our portion now
6:06
first step boil water when you boil the
6:09
water put it in a pan
6:11
when you put in a pipe add flour after
6:14
adding flour
6:16
start mingling mingle leave it for some
6:20
time
6:21
like you cover it mingle again until the
6:26
flour dissolves in the water then it
6:29
makes this solid that you're seeing
6:33
and then it can detach itself from the
6:36
saucepan
6:36
and when you see the saucepan with
6:39
turning brown like
6:40
this the best of the saucepan turning
6:42
brown like this it
6:43
means your portion is ready to eat
6:48
