plant millet i mean yeah millet and what
7:24
do you use the milk for this so these
7:26
are millet grains we're going to
7:30
sun dry them and then
7:32
we pound them and we get a small grains
7:36
and the grains we use them to
7:39
prepare okay like we grind them into
7:41
flour
7:42
and the flour we use it to prepare
7:45
porridge
7:46
porridge
7:47
porridge
7:49
so
7:50
we take millet porridge and then for the
7:52
soda we use it for
7:55
okay we grind it also and make powder
7:58
like sorghum flour
8:00
and then mix it with cassava flour to
8:02
make the
8:03
bread okay that bread is called queen in
8:06
my language
