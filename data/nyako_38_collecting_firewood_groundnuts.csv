so in today's video we are going to be
0:19
collecting firewood that is basically an
0:23
evening routine here in the village but
0:25
before we start collecting our firewood
0:28
we are eating our groundnuts so we had
0:31
to get some granites and roast them so
0:34
how did we roast them we didn't have a
0:35
saucepan yes as you can see we just cut
0:38
the groundnuts and put them on
0:40
the ground and put some
0:43
grass on it and then light fire
0:46
boom
0:47
it was ready for us to eat
0:49
yeah anyway so this is where we are
0:51
going to be
0:52
getting our firewood from today it's
0:54
just near our house
0:57
but it's a newly cultivated place so it
1:00
has a lot of
1:02
what can i say firewood yeah
1:05
so in the evening some people are still
1:10
digging and first we are looking for
1:12
firewood around as you can see i was
1:15
looking for
1:17
saiso
1:18
to
1:20
tie the
1:22
firewood to take home or to carry the
1:25
firewood with i don't know any of those
1:28
let's go into the video
1:33
so when you collect your firewood you
1:36
need something to tie them together in
1:38
order for you to carry them well at home
1:41
so basically for me i got the size so as
1:44
you can see and then pull them down
1:45
there so that i start arranging my
1:48
small pieces of firewood
1:50
as you can see in the video
2:07
yes like this this one here we are using
2:09
size
2:13
and then you put saison and then you
2:15
make them properly
2:17
make them proper
2:20
so that's calling
2:31
so that it cannot disturb you when
2:33
carrying it
2:48
you break them doesn't it long long you
2:52
break them
3:07
now we are going to see how they tie it
3:09
we shall see how they tie it
3:15
okay
3:16
they can tie it like this you hold this
3:18
part
3:19
you bring it here
3:20
and then you do like this
3:24
but the size is small
3:26
okay lemonade
3:42
after putting it back you do like this
3:45
so that the thing should be tight
3:48
you like this
3:50
how we can tie in our village they can
3:52
tie like this
3:55
like this this one here you put it here
3:59
and then you pull
4:00
this one you put it here
4:07
so
