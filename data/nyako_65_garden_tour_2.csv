1:23
fruits
1:24
these are berries i'm going to show you
1:26
i don't know how they call them in
1:27
english but for us like if you're a kid
1:29
in africa and you've never eaten this i
1:31
don't know what you're up to so the
1:34
green ones are still raw and these ones
1:37
this is like um
1:39
purple
1:40
yeah it's color purple
1:42
this is a ripened one and then it turns
1:45
black the more it gets ripe
1:48
turns black so that you don't eat the
1:49
green ones but you eat these ones the
1:51
purple ones
1:52
i think they are wild berries
1:56
so it has a seed
1:58
this is a seed
2:00
very nice
2:02
and add another one i used to eat them
2:04
when i was a kid but now i'm big
2:11
yeah
2:13
so that's it
2:16
they just grow by themselves no one
2:19
no one plants them they just bro
2:22
we have this nice flowers beautiful
2:25
i mean i like flowers i like putting
2:27
showers on my hair

2:32
did you guys see my hair style this is
2:35
like
2:36
african hair every time you put a
2:39
different hairstyle so in one week i
2:41
think i've changed my hair like
2:43
three times or four because the first
2:45
