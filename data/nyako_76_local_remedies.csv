2:08
i can say you know liquid

2:14
so this is beans
2:17
you can see they are fresh and nice
2:21
yeah but they are not here they still
2:22
have like one and a half months to go
2:25
yeah so it started now
2:28
we have one this is called moringa tree
2:30
and it's used for malaria also
2:33
if you feel like have fever
2:36
and
2:37
this is moringa it's a moringa tree we
2:40
use it as a local ab and spicy in a
2:45
sauce like you get this like this the
2:48
leaves and grind them
2:51
like dry them first after drying them
2:53
grind them
2:55
then
2:56
put them in your sauce but some people
2:58
use them for tea and steaming yeah so i
3:01
found it has its seeds the seeds are the
3:04
ones that are sold
3:05
yeah so so let's go here this is
3:08
our hub number one that we used to
3:10
do our local treatments let's go to
3:13
another one the indigenous one that i
3:16
know that i know better
3:18
better
3:21
so anyway this one is our second plant
3:23
it's so saturated
3:27
it's called uh
3:29
it's called
3:33
so
3:34
it is useful so to cure malaria if you
3:36
have malaria you get this
3:39
pound it and put it in water and then
3:42
drink it's very very bitter is it bitter
3:44
or sour like there's a very sour taste
3:46
but it really works i've grown up using
3:49
this yeah it really works so this is the
3:52
whole of that tree it's really huge but
3:54
already two small small trees but this
3:56
one is very huge
3:58
and that will take us to another one
4:02
another planet
4:04
so this one
4:06
i don't really know how it's called in
4:07
english also but it's for
4:09
skin like when you
4:11
when you have a newborn baby you get
4:14
this
4:15
with some other abs boil them and then
4:19
base the baby using this
4:22
using this so let's go
4:24
to our plant number
4:31
so this is how it looks like
4:34
it's really pretty so you see how its
4:36
skin is glowing
4:38
it's what is used like actually i think
4:41
because of this that's why they think it
4:42
also can make the baby's skin to glow so
4:46
we use it
4:47
to
4:48
treat the baby's skin like the new bone
4:51
to have a nice skin this is what they
4:54
use
4:54
yeah let's go
4:57
go
4:58
so guys this one
4:59
it's adit
5:01
so guys uh plant number four
5:04
did you know that we also have
5:05
detoxifiers like you don't have to
5:06
tablets don't have to go to spas to
5:08
detoxify we have a detox fire that is a
5:12
plant
5:13
so here it is
5:15
this one
5:16
see that detox fire
5:19
you boil it
5:20
so you boil it
5:22
and then drink the water so it cleanses
5:24
your stomach
5:26
yeah it's a detoxifier
5:30
so this is it
5:40
so this is our hub number five
5:43
i don't know how it's called in english
5:45
but in uganda it's called chiwampulata
5:47
so it's used to kill wounds like you
5:50
have a one you get it like this
5:53
like this and then
5:56
squeeze it
5:57
and do this
5:58
what i will come on
6:00
yeah then it's like juicy to start
6:02
bringing up some water as you can see
6:05
in my palms like
6:08
okay like this
6:10
yeah so this is what you apply in your
6:12
wounds and they will heal
6:17
so this is how it looks like this is a
6:19
plank
6:22
yeah this is our plant number five let's
6:25
go to plant number six six six six six
6:28
six
6:29
so this is red pepper
6:32
yeah
6:33
oh hot chili like hot chili so they use
6:36
it to cure ulcers you take probably like
6:39
10 of them every day just swallow them
6:42
you know you're gonna don't take hot
6:43
chili but then we use this for medicine
6:46
like for me saying purposes and then
6:49
eating on sauce
7:00
that's cause
7:02
it says this i am
7:04
these youngs they're rich in collision
7:07
so they really work well on people's
7:09
bones so but then everyone eats them but
7:12
for medicinal purposes older people eat
7:15
them a lot just help them so um this
7:18
year i'm zaru and i am under down there
7:21
so in the world when you approach this
7:23
probably i am will be there maybe i'll
7:25
show you guys when the time for
7:26
harvesting it but for now let's
7:29
concentrate on that medicinal part of it
7:31
that's the possibility
7:33
so guys we have come to the end of our
7:35
video hope you have enjoyed the video
7:37
please subscribe give me a thumbs up and
7:39

7:40
every time i post a video you're here
7:42
today with me i think that's it for
7:45
today see in the next video bye
7:48
guys before i go i had forgotten this so
7:50
there are a lot of plants
7:52
that we use like to treat
7:55
diseases here like a lot of plants like
7:58
trust me a lot of plants but then every
8:01
plant
8:02
every plant has its different
8:05
importance on someone's body literally
8:08
is plant for everything that cures this
8:10
that cure is that so
8:13
we have grown up knowing this is for
8:15
this like if you get a wound you know a
8:17
specific plant to use to heal your wound
8:20
if you get malaria you know which hub to
8:22
use for malaria or fever like literally
8:26
everything if we have even
8:28
plants that take away the venom let me
8:30
say you're beaten by a snake you know
8:32
which plant to use so
8:34
that's what
8:36
african society is all about they teach
8:38
you about different plants and their
8:40
uses
