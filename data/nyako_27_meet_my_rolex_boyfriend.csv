every time i post a video
2:06
you're there to fight with me let's go
2:09
so this is my outfit
2:34
eh
2:38
this is what what is funny with my place
2:40
you have to first jump
2:42
through like those switches you know i
2:45
get to
2:47
so anyway i was going to the road
2:50
experience just like her
2:52
three minutes to walk from my home
2:55
so that's it you can now see the place
2:58
that's my budapola stage
3:00
and that's where our trading center is
3:03
oh yeah
3:04
my rolex guy is yeah that's my boy
3:08
every time he sees meetings i'm going
3:10
somewhere
3:12
it's called a celebrity anyway
3:16
so when we are doing a rolex or making a
3:19
rolex or frying alone
3:23
you crack your eggs into a
3:26
cup as you can see then get some onions
3:30
slice them in the eggs
3:33
after slicing the onions as you can see
3:37
you can put as much onions as you want
3:40
but i like
3:41
the little onions
3:44
anyway after then you put some green
3:46
pepper but then he always asked me what
3:49
do you
3:49
want some chili in it do you want some
3:52
red pepper so you tell him what you want
3:54
then you can just put it there
3:58
what you want is what it gives you so
4:01
basically that's what i want a little
4:02
bit of green pepper a little bit of
4:04
onions and a little bit of tomato
4:07
mango tomatoes i prefer them raw
4:10
and then they put cabbage also
4:14
a little slices of cabbage and then put
4:16
in the mixture
4:18
either mix your mixology for that
4:23
for the rolex anyway
4:26
so that's what this story was
4:30
watching the video probably by the end
4:33
of this video you will get to know how
4:35
to make your own rolex at
4:36
all at home about my rolex stories nice
4:40
one that
4:44
when i make a real excitement i think
4:45
it's just more like
4:47
so taste testly like i but i everywhere
4:52
you know when you don't want it get it
4:55
easily
4:56
so after that you put some salt and then
4:59
you
4:59
mix it with mix
5:08
but that
5:23
mmm
6:08
[Music]
6:17
and then green pepper
6:46
hey
7:28
is
7:41
so after frying the eggs and the
7:44
cabbage and onions what they put um
7:49
they ask if they want raw tomatoes or
7:53
the tomatoes to be fried in but me i
7:55
prefer them so that's why
8:02
[Music]
8:10
oh
8:19
[Music]
8:21
so guys this is our rolex now it's ready
8:24
and
8:24
rolled i think it's called the rolex
8:26
because they know the eggs that's what i
8:29
think yeah so you have to pack it for me
8:31
put it in the pot
8:34
so it's okay here to use
8:53
[Music]
9:07

9:14
on alive
9:16
on a facebook live so
9:19
