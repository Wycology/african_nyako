0:34

0:38
and if you're my returning subscriber
0:41
thank you
0:42
thank you very much like who am i
0:47
anyway guys let's go into the video
0:53
so what you first do i don't know how
0:56
they call this
0:57
in english but is it
1:00
frame all resting it you first roast the
1:03
okay so here i'm resting it
1:08
it will have some nice aroma when you
1:12
roast it
1:12
first so this is what you do then after
1:15
you can soak it in warm water
1:18
so this is our step one
1:21
what you do first with your
1:25
[Music]
1:33
yeah i think we are done
1:40
wow this looks so nice so
1:43
nice
1:52
[Music]
1:53
so after after roasting it that's
1:56
when you can saute it or you can saute
1:59
it before you roast it
2:01
but my first roast then i can saute it
2:04
after and then i can add in
2:08
water so um i've boiled my water now so
2:12
i'm going to put in those
2:13
like it's silver like golden silver i
2:17
don't know
2:17
what to say but it was nice then
2:22
that's when i can add in my warm water
2:24
or boiled water
2:26
to soak it and wash it because these
2:28
things
2:29
most most times they already some
2:32
do it there is put them in soil so they
2:36
have like soil in them
2:38
you have to really wash them like
2:42
you wash them
2:48
anyway so
2:51
this water is very hot you can soak them
2:55
for some time
2:56
like five minutes or adding
2:59
water like cold water so that you can
3:03
wash it well yeah
3:06
so i have my tomatoes ready cut
3:10
and onions and garlic if you know uends
3:13
we don't really use a lot of tomatoes so
3:16
yeah i have that uganda name we use
3:19
a half a tomato and one little onion
3:24
so it's already in me yeah
3:29
so we have that can put some little oil
3:35
i think that's enough for us
3:39
yeah with our oil to
3:44
boil
3:46
and then
3:49
we put our onions not tomatoes
3:54
already put the garlic on
4:01
onions at the same time i have nothing
4:03
to waste
4:09
at the same time
4:27
i've turned into golden brown
4:30
that's right add the tomatoes
4:54
[Music]
5:01
this is the point switch i already put
5:04
some
5:05
so until my ancestors tell me to soak
5:15
i just pushed when my ancestors served
5:18
me to stop then i can't stop
5:26
so when you put the salt
5:29
and then the tomatoes and everything is
5:32
like cooking
5:34
adding your spices there no cheese with
5:35
me i put prisma
5:39
and this another raichu
5:43
reiko if you're in uganda you know rico
5:46
is the only
5:48
thing that we use kansai
5:53
anyway so let's see what we have now
5:58
let me put in the vertical
6:02
and then we see so you put in your mixed
6:05
spices
6:11
and a little bit of resin
6:16
oh whatever being sprayed at this point
6:18
it's going to add uh
6:19
okay yeah so you put your can make sure
6:22
it's clean
6:23
like quite broken listen
6:30
so when you put it in this is what you
6:32
have remember
6:38
and then this is where the magic begins
6:44
how am i going to do this
6:49
i always get an egg
6:54
this is my magic
6:56
[Applause]
6:59
and then
7:12
this is my discovery like i did this by
7:15
myself like one time i was talking about
7:16
like why did i put it
7:17
in this but i don't like the fragrance
7:20
i decided to discover this this is
7:24
only one thing so here you just cover it
7:27
and give it like three minutes to cook
7:37
so we are good to go now ready you can
7:39
either make
7:40
sure oh that's okay
7:49
