going to start by lighting up a sigiri
0:36
like
0:36
a charcoal stuff so i'm not going to use

that
0:41
because we don't have firewood right now
0:44
it's rained on our firewood and they are
0:45
still wet
0:46
so i'm going to be using a charcoal
0:50
so let's start the video
1:05
where is this
1:24
yeah so you get a poison
1:28
that's what you use to light up this
1:48
there's a lot of
1:51
wind here
1:55
okay
2:19
people
2:41
so this is how you light up this
2:45
you guys i'm going to keep saying that
2:47
shigeri because i find it hard to say to
2:49
say i shaku stove whatever
2:52
so
2:55
you've learned her luganda words
3:10
so
3:25
so we leave this to be lighting lighting
3:28
up and then i go look for the
3:30
spices but you are going to put in our
3:33
tea
3:34
yeah so let's go
3:41
so i have to clean the saucepan that
3:43
you're going to use to boil the tree
3:53
when i go you will
4:08
[Music]
4:13
i'm going to put it on
4:21
[Music]
4:39
so guys we have to look for the spices
4:42
spicy leaves that we're going to use to
4:43
spice up our tea so here is wonderful
4:49
so that's when we put it in our tea it's
4:52
called mujirja so i don't know how it's
4:54
called in english so this is what you do
5:00
like they have this nice
5:02
nice scent
5:05
so we put it
5:18
food
5:27
okay it is one type of specialist dance
5:29
and get the second one let's go second
5:32
one is not here so it's just behind the
5:34
house let's go there
5:44
over
6:06
[Music]
6:25
asia
6:40
ah
6:49
so guys this is still morning so they
6:52
have these things due on them so you
6:54
have to do this
6:55
and then get
7:01
these ones
7:04
they also have a very nice aroma so
7:07
we're going to put them in there in our
7:09
water
7:11
and we spice up our tea
7:15
me it's very nice
7:25
i think this is enough
7:38
so we don't have this at our home so we
7:41
came and got it at our neighbor's home
7:43
here that's where i always get it from
7:46
because they have a lot of it here
7:49
so they don't mind us having
7:51
like having it from their place every
7:53
time
7:54
that's why we are so reluctant about
7:56
planting hours
8:16
[Music]
8:20
foreign
8:42
okay
9:06
when you got your neighbors home and you
9:08
find them eating you have to join them
9:10
and you eat
9:11
so we are eating
9:13
and they gave us some potatoes
9:17
and what is so
9:19
different about our potatoes these are
9:20
sweet potatoes
9:24
it has a potato so they cook them with
9:26
the peels on
9:28
hiding nutritions
9:31
so you remove the pills like this
9:35
um
9:40
when my babies are eating fancy
9:43
they've given us so
9:45
here
9:46
in my village you don't just leave
9:48
people eating and you don't join them
9:50
you have to eat with them
9:52
otherwise you'll save a bad person
9:55
that's why we bought some potatoes and
9:57
now we are going to cook our tea but we
9:58
have
9:59
