0:58
the stem
0:59
this is how we remove it
1:09

1:52
leaves to cook our lunch
1:54
hope you guys enjoy that video we still
1:56
need this also
1:58
so we have to collect them all
2:02
and then
2:04
we go let's go to the kitchen
2:19
these
2:20
ones
2:22
some people call them plantain but for
2:24
us this is not what you call plantain
2:25
platinum it's a sweeter one when you
2:27
boil it it's sweet so this is called
2:29
banana like banana for eating so today
2:32
we are cooking the bananas using the
2:33
banana leaves
2:35
it's like steaming anyway but you use
2:37
bananas so you have to first put this
2:41
in the saucepan
2:46
to protect the bananas from getting the
2:48
water that you put in a saucepan below
2:52
so you put this smoothing on you
2:55
called mizing on your hello
3:00
yeah
3:01
so this is ready
3:03
and then you get this
3:10
let me first put a half of this
3:16
down here
3:22
like this
3:24
then you get a bigger one
3:44
and then
3:55
like this
3:57
and then
4:07
you have to hold it like this
4:09
where is my knife
4:22
okay
4:35
then you put them
4:42
so that's what we have done so far and
4:44
we are still continuing
4:59
so this matoke
5:02
is
5:03
predominantly
5:04
or predominantly
5:07
eaten
5:08
by people in the central part of uganda
5:11
that is the verganda
5:13
people
5:14
and the soga i think but vasuda mostly
5:16
eats with potatoes but you are going to
5:18
be cooking sweet potatoes also because
5:20
this mataki is not enough for the whole
5:22
family
5:23
i told you we have a very huge family
5:26
so this cannot be enough for us
5:29
i'm going to cook this and then put some
5:32
sweet potato also
5:34
as you'll be seeing
5:37
and you don't have to hold this metal
5:39
like this when you're peeling just to be
5:41
like this
5:42
how you see i do it i don't know why but
5:44
that's how they told me to do it and
5:47
that's how everyone
5:49
does it in uganda mostly in central part
5:53
of uganda
6:07
perfect
6:23
so
6:35
um
7:21
so
7:33
right
7:51
so these are our potatoes sweet potatoes
7:54
we are going to add them on this but let
7:57
me first do this
7:59
i have to sprinkle some water here
8:05
and then
8:09
do this
8:24
then this side also do like this
8:29
and here
8:29
[Applause]
8:31
also like this
8:33
and then we put our sweet potato on the
8:36
top
8:40
like this
8:51
so i did i did not peel them because
8:53
swear is like it with with the pills on
8:56
so you peel it when you're going to eat
8:58
it like that
9:00
and then you get this one
9:02
i need to wash it a little
9:06
bit and then
9:11
cover our food
9:14
properly
9:15
[Applause]
9:18
and turn this way
9:22
do this
9:24
cover it as well
9:30
cover it as well
9:33
and then you have to put water
9:36
so you have to get
9:38
this
9:49
so you use this so that the water does
9:51
not go in food but rather go down the
9:54
saucepan like under the saucepan
9:56
i think this is enough
10:10
and then you put on
10:13
that i'm going to put fire
10:16
and then
10:17

10:18
