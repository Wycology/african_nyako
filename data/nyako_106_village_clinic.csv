1:43
the syringe and then it's going to
1:46
inject it on my veins you people
1:48
yesterday was a hell like he had to
1:50
first look for the vein i cried the hell
1:54
out of me
1:56
so yesterday when i weighed myself i was
1:58
um
2:00
should i tell you my weight no
2:04
no
2:05
but that's the doctor you people
2:08
that's the doctor and really is really
2:10
experienced because uh
2:13
according to the tablet she gave me
2:15
another tablet like the injection he
2:17
gave me i really felt relieved i felt a
2:21
great improvement that fever went away
2:23
just within 12
2:25
hours i'm okay now i'm i can't even walk
2:28
around
2:29
but on christmas i was bad love
2:33
anyway
2:35
so let's go into the video
2:44
so he had to put
2:46
the
2:47
medicine here to inject it through my
2:50
veins but yesterday it's when he put
2:52
that cannula on my finger
2:56
it was hell to look for the vein like
3:00
the guy was just
3:02
pricking me everywhere i cried so today
3:06
that uh
3:07
those
3:08
thai food medicine have like this
3:12
burning sensation like you feel your
3:14
veins are burning or your skin that's if
3:17
they don't target the vein itself so i
3:20
think he missed it somewhere so when
3:22
he's putting
3:24
my
3:25
hand can be like swelling that's why i
3:27
told him to remove the to remove it
3:30
today after putting that it should
3:32
remove it then tomorrow we shall put on
3:34
my other hand
3:36
yeah
3:38
so it's going to remove it then tomorrow
3:41
we can put on my other hand
3:44
maybe i'll feel better at night was
3:47
painting i just wanted to pluck it off
3:50
and i feared
3:51
so yeah
3:53
it's going to remove it and then
3:55
tomorrow it's another house
3:58
looking for the vein and putting it on
4:00
the other hand i have to go through the
4:02
process again
4:05
but better than me staying with this
4:08
kind of the whole day and the vein is
4:10
hurting
4:12
yeah
4:14
so he's removing it then i can feel free
4:18
again
4:19
but it's hard stress me the process is
4:22
painful i don't know if you just put it
4:24
badly because i don't usually get this
4:27
pain when they are putting those things
4:28
on my hand
4:30
but this time around trust me it was
4:32
blood hell like it was painful you
4:35
people so i just asked him to remove it
4:38
i'll just pay for another cannula
4:40
tomorrow oh yeah i am at least now
4:45
you can see when the place is all i
4:48
don't know cooked
4:51
yeah anyway
4:53

6:40
the money to buy something else that was
6:42
the sugar
6:44
and she lives
6:46
so yeah she was measuring for me and i
6:48
