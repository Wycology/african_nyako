anytime
5:13
this knife is bland

6:10
so this is how we peel make sure you
6:12
hold it
6:13
like this not like this
6:16
there's realize that when you hold like
6:18
it means you're cutting off your kid's
6:20
head so you have to hold like this okay
6:22
and then you do this
6:26
like this
6:36
then you're done
6:38
then you put them there so you guys let
6:40
