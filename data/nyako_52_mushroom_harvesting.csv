0:32
life
0:51
this is how i upgrade them from the
0:53
ground
0:58

1:06
you have to make sure that you don't
1:08
break them understand
1:10

1:13
and today
1:15
this is what we are going to have for
1:17
our lunch i'm going to show you guys
1:20
either when i'm cooking if it's
1:22
necessary
1:24
i don't know just
1:26
tell me in the comment section below if
1:28
you want to see me cooking the mushroom
1:30
this is what we are having so i've got
1:32
some tomatoes also
1:35
so these ones we don't really plant them
1:37
but they just grow by themselves so
1:40
basically
1:43
you know i'm always with my twins
1:46
these here
1:50
all right
1:51
so i'm already with them
1:53
anyway so today we are going to have
1:55
this for lunch
1:58
let me take you through the process how
1:59
we cook it how we prepare it and
2:03
hope you enjoy this video
2:08
okay guys
2:11
let's see each other at the kitchen
2:15
[Music]
2:28
[Music]
3:03
so this is how we clean this
3:06
you have to make sure you remove the
3:08
outer
3:10
memory is it a memory memory
3:13
so this is you have to remove this part
3:15
you don't eat it
3:31
so i'm here with my two guys helping me
3:34
to do this
3:35
as fast as we can so that we can have
3:38
our lunch in time
3:51
so
4:07
so you guys comment below if you guys
4:09
have also the same mushrooms like ours
4:11
these big big mushrooms
4:14
by the way there are some types of
4:15
mushrooms that they don't eat up tiny
4:17
black ones so they're not eaten here by
4:20
people but then they say that they are
4:23
for night dancers that night dancers can
4:26
eat them so i don't know how sure it is
4:28
but all i can say they are poisonous so
4:31
that's why they cannot be eaten
4:33
by the human being
4:36
so this one has finished his you can see
4:38
us put it there
4:46
so you guys we are just going to put
4:48
them here and then we sand dry them
4:51
so that we can prepare them with
4:55
peanut butter or
4:58
fish dry fish so any of that so
5:01
i'll not be showing you guys how we are
5:03
going to cook it maybe maybe not because
5:05
it has to dry to going to take like a
5:07
day or two because there is no sunshine
5:10
then
5:11
after when it gets dry
5:14
that's when
5:17
we will show you guys
5:20
we have to put them in two pieces
5:22
so they can sun dry
5:25
as fast as possible
5:34
but then some people always eat this by
5:36
the way and it's very nice
6:02
anyway guys let's stop this video also
6:05
here
6:07
and i'm going to sandwich them probably
6:10
maybe i will show you guys when it's dry
6:13
or not because i still have a lot of
6:15
things to do so i'll not be
6:17
able to show you
6:18
guys but probably maybe maybe not
6:22
anyway
