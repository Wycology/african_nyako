0:06

0:08
giving me a thumbs up and pressing the
0:10
notification bell so that
0:12
every time i post a video you're the
0:15
first person to watch it
0:30
[Music]
0:36
titled now like what i'm going to talk
0:38
about because i'm here to talk about
0:40
amara di mango
0:42
and david junior yeah so before i go
0:45
into the video
0:47
please let's pray for the virginia he's
0:49
sick i think he has malaria
0:52
according to what um ayamara said
0:56
during his live stream so they are in
0:59
nairobi
1:01
and there is no feeling when so let's
1:03
put him into our prayers
1:05
and quick recovery to him so basically
1:09
click on
1:10
this video to know why they don't have
1:12
videos and this is the truth
1:14
only nothing much but
1:17
only the truth why these these
1:21
guys don't have
1:22
video uploads these days why
1:25
reason number one so um i
1:28
am mara went on the live stream and told
1:31
us
1:31
why he or them
1:34
why him david junior and
1:38
tim wagon don't have videos this
1:41
so he basically told us that the reason
1:43
as to why he's not posting videos
1:46
or they don't have uploads this week is
1:49
because
1:50
one day virginia is sick so he has been
1:53
there taking care of him wow he's such a
1:55
good
1:55
sibling so he's such a good sibling like
1:58
what i admire about ayamura is this guy
2:02
who loves his family like he loves his
2:04
siblings he can't do
2:06
anything for them for that yeah he is
2:09
so big up to him he's really a good guy
2:12
like he's a family guy
2:14
he can like he just stopped traveling
2:16
just
2:17
so now that can make us know why i am
2:20
he's not posting but rather doing live
2:23
streams when he gets time
2:25
because he has to be there for the union
2:27
and then why is team onegoing knows
2:29
posting like
2:30
not uploading videos on youtube does she
2:33
need that break
2:34
does she is she quitting youtube as she
2:39
told us
2:40
ah you're probably wondering how i'm
2:42
also wondering so here it is
2:44
she's not quitting youtube she's not
2:46
even near to quitting youtube
2:48
she's not even a second to quit youtube
2:51
basically this is what is happening with
2:53
our team one goal
2:55
the manga was um finalizing with her
2:59
final exam examinations and clearing
3:03
like clearing like yeah
3:07
so she was clearing with the university
3:09
i think
3:10
if you follow her on instagram you can
3:13
see that
3:14
even her last video she said that she's
3:16
like she's finalizing with uh
3:18
campus the university so basically and
3:21
she needed a break
3:23
on youtube you people she needed a break
3:26
she's a human being like
3:27
she's a hard-working girl so this guy
3:30
she also wanted to give her on
3:32
time but i pray to god soon or later
3:35
she's going to be
3:36
back to give us another hot content
3:40
so she will be entertaining us as usual
3:43
let's pray all goes well let her
3:45
finalize
3:46
and then in that case also i might
3:49
say that mara said said
3:53
they're going to be having a party like
3:54
two parties for the one
3:56
one in their village and another one in
3:59
nairobi
4:01
yes so basically
4:04
we shall all the best congratulations
4:06
the mango
4:08
and quick recovery
4:11
david junior virginia yeah
4:15
and then for ayam mara thank you very
4:18

4:19

4:22

4:24

4:26
london
4:28
[Music]
4:30
is just this guy who is there for his
4:33
siblings like
4:35
