4:13
horse because we are farmers here before
4:15
we are farmers so this is how you pick
4:17

4:58
and we have this place
5:00
that lets out the smoke yeah
5:03
and this is our utensils down here
5:06
when we clean them that's when we put
5:08
them on top here
5:11
and then what i forgot to show you guys
5:14
is this
5:16
this one
5:18
we use it to cover the food like
5:20
food when you cook food put it here or
5:23
put on that thingy and cover it like
5:26
this
5:28
cover it like this and you take follow
5:30
these styles so
5:32
you don't just take your food without
5:34
covering you have to get this and cover
5:36
food and then you take it to your
5:39
visitors
5:40
what else are very much in your days and
5:43
then this is our sitting
5:45
thing
5:46
this one
5:48
you sit when you're cooking and then you
5:51
can cook or you can carry the baby like
5:54
my boy here
5:55
and then you enjoy
5:58
good time together
6:00
like this and then you say get it get it
6:07
yeah
6:08
that's it and then write to us and i'm
6:10
gonna show you guys our mingling stick
6:14
so we really use like a real stick to
6:16
mingle like this
6:22
so guys this is how we make soda
6:24
bicarbonate
6:26
you get like hash
6:28
when you get hash from the
6:30
from there where you cook from you put
6:32
it here and then you make some little
6:36
holes in the tin
6:38
and you put some grass under and then
6:40
you put that
6:42
thingy there
6:43
after maybe i should make a video and i
6:45
show you guys how we make
6:47
the soda bicarbonate so yeah i'll make a
6:50
video about it also
6:52
so don't worry this is soldered by
6:54
carbonite
6:56
and then
6:58
this is where we keep
7:00
our serious
7:03
this is cow peas
7:10
so this is it we keep it here in the
7:12
things when you use that thing you don't
7:13
throw it away
7:15
because we always need it to either
7:17
store something
7:19
like the seeds or anything so we don't
7:21
throw our empty tin so this one might
7:24
sit here
7:25
like for years and years thank you as if
7:28
we have had this like for four years
7:31
probably someone brought it
7:34
from kampala
7:36
yeah
7:37
[Applause]
7:38
we don't really this one this one is
7:41
called kk
7:42
okay in english it's called a sieve if
7:45
i'm not mistaken so if you watched my
7:47
video making cassava flower yeah this is
7:50
what i was using and if you haven't
7:52
watched that video if you haven't
7:54
watched that video go watch it you're
7:56
going to see this how i used it
7:59
in the video how we make cassava flour
8:01
you sell us using this sieve so please
8:05
yeah let's eat and then what else what
8:08
else do we have
8:10
we have this dream this is
8:12
this one
8:14
it's from
8:16
it's for the
8:17
bicycle but first when we are young we
8:19
used to use it like this
8:22
we used to use it like
8:24
this but now i'm always
8:28
i don't know
8:30
so yeah
8:32
but i think they just kept it
8:35
and
8:36
so this they think they kept it in case
8:38
we are building another house we will
8:40
put it on top of the house there
8:43
there there there
8:45
yeah so you can see here it's really
8:47
dark that's because of the
8:50
suit or
8:52
smoke from the fireplace
8:55
that's why this color is black but we
8:58
don't care that's how we live
9:00
because we don't care my baby wants to
9:03
swing the thing around his
9:06
west but he can not do
9:09
it cause he is still young
9:13
i think
9:15
i tell someone what else
9:18
so this one it's a water it's for spices
9:23
put spices pound them
9:26
and then cook your food
9:29
