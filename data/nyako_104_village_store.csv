5:04
it's a prettier in your garden to eat
5:08
one time i'll show you when it's ready
5:11
this is our name
5:40
so guys what happened here i'd come to
5:42
show you the um
5:44
granary but i found this teacher i help
5:47
you you remember my uncle
5:51
yesterday posted the video when he was
5:53
sanitizing like he was taking alcohol in
5:55
the morning and he was already drunk so
5:57
the same thing today is already drunk
5:59
but he's like no if you have a camera
6:01
come and take my picture because we have
6:03
a trophy that we won when we are playing
6:06
football with the other village so like
6:10
we had kids play football on christmas
6:13
day
6:14
that is what probably kept people busy
6:16
they were all at the pitch washing
6:18
football but i couldn't make it there
6:21
so they were showing me that and then
6:23
told me to take a picture of it and they
6:25
need a picture
6:27
by tomorrow rwanda i'd copy tomorrow
6:32
so this is the trophy that the village
6:35
kids and whatever
6:37
yeah they were and they were playing a
6:39
christmas football to have like football
6:42
tournament between the villages so this
6:44
is what they want and it's a school
6:46
teacher
6:47
the primary scholarship which class do
6:49
you teach
6:50
primary what
6:52
not selective
6:54
not selective i'm not understanding but
6:56
we subject duties
6:59
mathematics
7:01
science science so he teaches science
7:04
and math
7:05
and mathematics
7:08
so by not selective he meant that he can
7:11
teach any class from primary one to
7:13
primary seven on any subject but is
7:16
basically doing math and science
7:35
so back to what i brought us here anyway
7:37
so i wanted to show you
7:39
guys how we use the granary
7:42
so the upper part like the roof is
7:45
removable you can remove it and put it
7:48
down and then put it up as i showed you
7:49
in the beginning of the video like the
7:52
roof is
7:54
crated differently from them
7:57
from the basement so it's not like the
8:00
heart when we're building our houses we
8:02
build them all together but for the
8:04
granary you build them separate and then
8:07
put the roof on top of it and use that
8:10
pole to move it
8:12
when you want to put it inside so
8:14
there's a
8:16
sogum and
8:18
millet but it's just the beginning of
8:20
the dry season so there will probably be
8:22
a lot of crops to be put there with time
8:26
yeah so and then after you have to put
8:29
it back
8:30
you just remove the
8:32
pole
8:33
like slowly so it doesn't fall down
8:37
and you cover it so when you do that
8:39
your crops are really like the produces
8:43
are really safe from
8:46
like the rats
8:48
anything that can destroy them that's
8:50
how you keep them safe
8:52
so the little holes that you can see on
8:55
the wall of the granary are just left
8:57
there purposely for aeration so that
9:00
that so that the crops don't get spoiled
9:03
by a lot of warmth
9:06
so they really like it should be aerated
9:10
and still
9:12
not allowing water there so that's how
9:15
that's the purpose of the little holes
9:18
on the granary i hope
9:22
you guys can learn something from this
9:24
video
9:25
yeah
9:26
i was showing you how they opened the
9:29
granary and how they closed it
9:32
but the noises were so so much like
9:34
there's a lot of noise that's why i
9:36
couldn't talk but um i think you guys
9:38
have seen there's millet
9:41
there
9:42
and sogam
9:44
so yeah i think that's the end of our
9:46
video
9:47
um forgive me for being
9:49
low because i'm sick
9:51
but i'm trying to keep up with you guys
9:54
yesterday i couldn't have video
9:57

9:58
