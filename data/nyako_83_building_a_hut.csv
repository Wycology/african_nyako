a new newly built heart or there are
0:02
still anyway still under construction
0:04
but let's go
0:27
let me show you
0:32
[Music]
0:38
welcome back to my youtube channel in
0:40
case you're new please subscribe hit the
0:41
like button and press the notification
0:43
bell so one of my subscribers was asking
0:46
me what we use to build our hearts like
0:48
the houses what we call them houses
0:51
our houses what we use to build them so
0:53
today i'm going to show you because we
0:55
are building a house right there but i'm
0:57
going to show you the grass that is
0:59
because the person asked me which brush
1:01
that you use these are the grasses
1:04
but um
1:06
i'm going to show you how they are
1:11
so this is a tip of it
1:15
so during this season
1:17
like last two months they just went and
1:19
then
1:20
cut them from them
1:23
okay from the bush you go because there
1:26
has been many like many so you can cut
1:29
them and then tie them like no first
1:31
make them dry when you dry them up
1:34
then you tie them like this
1:36
so if you're just selling them to
1:38
someone this one cost like um
1:41
between
1:42
one to two dollars
1:44
yeah
1:45
so but then if you just go and get them
1:47
in the bush it's for free
1:49
so this is it so you just get
1:52
heaps
2:00
for some time by the way like this can
2:02
take you like two months to gather all
2:04
of this so it's really expensive but in
2:06
every homestead that you go to you will
2:08
find these hips there because if they
2:10
keep them to either sell
2:12
or to renovate their houses so that
2:15
house
2:18
it's going to be renovated and the other
2:20
one is going to be viewed so
2:23
let me show you a new review
2:26
let me show you a new a newly built hat
2:28
oh there's still anyway still under
2:30
construction but let's go
2:58
um
3:07
this is our way of making what i told
3:10
you you put here i think you guys watch
3:12
this video you can watch my video about
3:16
making
3:17
african brew
3:19
this is how you make this is destination
3:20
method this is still here it goes here
3:23
cool down from this and then this is the
3:26
liquor
3:27
just if you drink it
3:30
so
3:44
someone cooking this he's also cooking
3:46
their food here so it's simple you don't
3:48
have to go in the kitchen we like
3:49
cooking at the outer space because of
3:51
the smoke
3:53
and then inside is very hot at this time
3:57
so yeah this is food
4:00
for breakfast
4:43
[Music]
4:46
anyway
4:47
that will take us to our video for today
5:03
uh so the person who asked me what we
5:05
used to build our houses here we go
5:08
these are the poles i meant actually i
5:10
replied to him that he used pulse but he
5:12
never got to another like yes i know it
5:14
so this is one of it
5:18
these ones
5:27
under construction
5:29
they have these small ones that can be
5:31
bent
5:34
this one can be bent
5:36
and then tied on the poles
5:40
and then this is for the roofing
5:42
why not i don't think you can see the
5:44
details up there for that roof so they
5:47
got this
5:48
they get these small ones and then they
5:51
tie them like this but on the top inside
5:53
and out
5:54
so that it can be firm
5:57
and then after this
6:00
i'm going to show you guys a small one
6:02
but let me just show you this is the
6:04
grass
6:05
actually something unique about this
6:07
grass is reusable so after like 10 years
6:10
they get it out then they remove
6:13
whatever bad ones
6:14
and they mix it with a fresh grass and
6:18
they put it back on the roof so that's
6:20
what they are going this is that this is
6:22
already used but they're going to reuse
6:24
it but we'll mix it with a new dress
6:29
so i'm going to show you the small ones
6:32
the smaller
6:35
to make this i don't know if it's making
6:37
sense what they do
6:40
these ones
6:42
are the small ones that they use for
6:44
roofing
6:45
so they are bendable like
6:51
[Music]
6:54
see they don't break so that's what they
6:56
use for roofing like it goes around here
7:00
as you can see this one
7:03
goes around around and then that's where
7:06
they will put the
7:07
grass on
7:09
and then after
7:11
it will take us to
7:13
putting mud like i guess these bricks
7:16
they're not really bricks
7:17
these ones
7:19
and then they put them like this
7:22
all over the place and then they get
7:24
smart they put mud
7:26
and the last stage is to smear it i have
7:30
a video and i'm smearing the floor so
7:32
you know how they do it
7:35
so this house we are preparing it like
7:38
um
7:39
for people who want to come and visit
7:41
probably you'll have where to stay so by
7:44
now just build it slowly by slowly
7:47
actually i wanted to make you guys a
7:49
video from the start but my phone wasn't
7:51
working so that's why you've missed a
7:53
lot from the starting point up to now
