1:28
for a successful business here let's go
1:31
into the business things to avoid
1:35
in order to do so
1:38
number one but before you please

1:44
subscribe to
1:45
my channel
1:50
like this for you subscribe so
1:53
number one what to avoid number one
1:56
doing what you love so someone's like
1:59
how can i ever do what i love
2:01
yeah you can avoid to do what
2:04
doing a business because you love it oh
2:06
because i love cooking
2:09
let me do let me make a restaurant
2:14
you love cooking but are you good at
2:15
cooking
2:18
are you good at cooking so basically
2:21
someone who is
2:22
good at cooking and you're at a risk
2:27
you are at a great risk because
2:31
for you just love cooking but do you
2:33
know how to
2:34
cook so that's the best example avoid
2:37
doing a business because you love it do
2:40
it because you have the skills
2:42
because you have the ability
2:46
and then the willingness you understand
2:50
so avoid doing what you love because you
2:53
will
2:54
be living in denial you're doing
2:55
something oh i love
2:58
this i love fashion let me
3:01
sell clothes you won't sell clothes but
3:04
then you don't have
3:05
skills you don't have marketing skills
3:07
you cannot
3:08
sell to someone
3:12
you're wasting your time you're wasting
3:14
your time
3:16
so the realistic is that you may not be
3:19
skilled
3:20
in what you love and there is a
3:23
whole lot of people and there is a lot
3:25
of people
3:28
out there who love things they are not
3:30
good
3:31
master really the reality
3:34
a lot of people trust me love things are
3:37
not good
3:38
and i feel like i love um what can i say
3:42
let me still use cooking i love cooking
3:46
but am i good at it
3:49
question mark so the person who thinks
3:52
she's a great cook
3:54
so she could set up a hotel is at a big
3:58
risk
4:00
get me you better friends
4:03
do what you were able to do
4:06
skills sustained like can you sustain
4:10
that business are you skilled
4:13
through that career like don't do
4:15
something because you love it yeah you
4:17
have to love whatever you're doing
4:18
but love can come in if you're skilled
4:22
yeah that is they then start a business
4:24
with um
4:28
enough capital like plan plan my idea
4:32
plan what do i i mean some people be
4:36
like
4:36
i have a business in mind i think it's
4:39
going to cost
4:40
5 million but i have 2 million
4:44
so you're going to go and rent a place
4:46
for that business for 1 million then 1
4:48
million
4:48
furnishing it so where's the money for
4:50
the stock
4:53
set up your business with enough capital
4:56
please first
4:58
look for the capital then
5:02
number two is um number three number
5:04
three
5:06
it's before starting up your business
5:08
look into your business plan
5:10
so most people don't have business plans
5:12
they just get money and be like boom i
5:14
want to start a business did you plan
5:15
for the business did you
5:18
the new plan for the business
5:22
so plan for the business look into your
5:24
business plan for
5:26
amount of money allocated to successful
5:28
startup of the business
5:30
raise that capital
5:33
raise that capital first and then set up
5:35
the business
5:37
don't make a mistake of starting up your
5:39
business with little capture you will
5:42
pluck it to death you will shock your
5:45
business today
5:46
you will kill your business your
5:48
business
5:50
so please first get the money collected
5:52
then you can start it
5:53
instead collect all the required funds
5:56
prior to starting up your business
6:00
collect all the money you want for the
6:02
business plan like
6:03
plan prior to make your things easy
6:07
understand so another thing
6:15
do not expect success don't expect
6:19
success like boom out of the blue you'll
6:21
be like when i start a business
6:22
just to succeed my idea you will be
6:25
shocked
6:26
you'll be shocked so what you have to do
6:28
it is not bad to expect success in your
6:30
business
6:31
but you have to accept the reality that
6:33
a business is
6:34
not a bed of roses and
6:38
it has ups and downs they'll always
6:40
exist in your business
6:42
even if you too optimistic
6:46
you have to accept that things going
6:49
wrong
6:50
sometimes sometimes things might go
6:53
wrong so
6:55
better have that in mind that's why the
6:58
reason don't put all your eggs
7:00
in one basket you understand
7:04
yeah don't put all your eggs in one
7:08
basket because there is reality and it
7:10
will shock you
7:13
reality will shock you
7:17
so for example if you
7:21
take some some time one month and
7:25
so you might such a business that it can
7:27
take some time
7:29
and even a year before you make real
7:31
cells in your business if you
7:34
if you're let me say
7:37
faint had faint-heartedly
7:40
like money
7:51
like many other people that's that
7:54
enterprise you might
7:55
end up closing down your business but if
7:59
you are
8:00
open-minded and patient
8:03
your business will show a broad
8:06
from the last cell period
8:09
to to start making like substantial
8:15
profits so basically you have to know
8:17
that yeah there are bad days
8:19
bad times for businesses don't be like
8:22
oh and i start business
8:23
boom like from the initiative
8:27
part then to developing maturity
8:32
ideas you might be on a starting point
8:35
like for four years
8:38
but then you can't have an open mind if
8:40
you go with that mindset that yeah
8:42
i know something amazing you might even
8:44
think more like think more and then boom
8:47
your business will
8:49
have a great time now that
8:52
another thing another thing
8:57
mistake that you have to that you do
9:00
people like you before you do in your
9:02
business yes
9:03
do you want by doing it all by yourself
9:06
like
9:06
why do you have to do it all by yourself
9:09
as i say because no man is an island so
9:12
if your business requires more than one
9:14
person some businesses that
9:16
need only one person but if the business
9:19
requires
9:20
only a single person to operate it well
9:23
and good
9:24
but if you're starting up a type of
9:26
business
9:28
it is perfect okay to run it your way
9:32
if it's for one person it's okay however
9:35
if your business supports
9:37
more than three people to work
9:40
in it and you are working in it as a
9:43
single person
9:45
you're putting your business in danger
9:48
you're putting your business and then
9:50
you trust me invest
9:51
like hire people let me say your
9:53
business is like for sales
9:55
like you need to do
9:59
surgery like you have to move around get
10:02
customers
10:03
can you do it alone hi people and get
10:06
you play but there are people who can
10:08
work
10:09
for like ten thousand and they let them
10:11
do for yourselves
10:13
trust me you're going the more you
10:15
invest in your business the more you get
10:17
the returns you understand
10:19
so i don't know another thing
10:23
another thing is um
10:26
market research do you even research
10:27
before starting up a business
10:29
do you like did you do your research or
10:31
you just started a business
10:34
so you have to do a market research most
10:37
business owners don't
10:38
bother owners they don't bother to make
10:41
a research on the business they want
10:44
to start prior to starting my business
10:47
which is a great mistake you're doing
10:50
it's so big like a great mistake you're
10:53
doing
10:55
so such businesses don't always last
10:58
because you've missed out the version of
11:00
like the
11:01
vital part of the business feel missing
11:03
oh
11:04
trust me like you didn't make any
11:06
research marketing
11:08
you don't know why you're competitors
11:09
you don't know how many people are doing
11:11
the same businesses for you just go
11:13
there
11:14
what do you expect they expect the
11:16
business also work out
11:18
well compared to the other person who
11:20
made
11:21
a recycling for one year before starting
11:24
the business
11:26
so such businesses have collapsed have
11:29
collapsed
11:31
yeah they are another point is a pattern
11:36
like doing partnership with wrong people
11:38
when you start
11:39
your business and you have like three
11:41
partners for
11:43
business partners and that's what i mean
11:46
forgive me my accent
11:49
so when you have wrong partners in the
11:51
business and you guys cannot do like
11:54
agree on the decisions on the way
11:56
forward
11:57
for the business trust me it will not
11:59
work out you guys all have to be on the
12:01
same page like you have to
12:03
make sure you
12:08
you
12:11
decide on what is good for the business
12:13
put away your differences and
12:15
make sure everything you're deciding is
12:18
for the betterment of the business so
12:22
work out for you well another one is uh
12:26
recruiting wrong people if you request
12:28
from people
12:30
me as a human resource manager i can
12:32
tell you that if you recruit
12:34
wrong people trust me
12:39
you're not going anywhere your business
12:40
is not going to do anything
12:42
for you so basically you have to make
12:45
sure you recruit
12:47
good people select a better fit for your
12:50
business
12:51
you understand so the human resource is
12:54
also a very important
12:56
aspect in the business yeah
13:00
so another thing another mistake that
13:02
people do they don't look for their
13:04
strengths
13:04
ability and weaknesses we are human
13:07
beings you have your weaknesses please
13:09
when you're starting a business first do
13:11
that study analyze be like where's my
13:14
strengths
13:15
where's my weaknesses and how can i do
13:17
this
13:18
like you understand focus more on your
13:21
strengths
13:23
work on your weaknesses
13:26
and then everything will be fine for
13:29
your business
13:30
you understand another thing is poor
13:33
planning that's a
13:34
mistake people do like
13:38
your plan but you've not done any
13:40
research
13:41
like how are you going to do that
13:43
business when you didn't plan well like
13:45
you didn't even do that market research
13:48
research and plan get a pen and paper
13:51
write whatever
13:53
like this internet why don't you use it
13:55
use internet to get whatever
13:57
