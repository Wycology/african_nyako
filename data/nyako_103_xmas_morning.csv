terrible fever yesterday after shooting

0:23
so i went and got some tablets sorry for
0:26
the background noises like
0:28
the guts they have already released them
0:30
for the dry season so during the dry
0:33
season
0:34
they always release their guts and make
0:36
them move freely
0:39
so after like two months they'll come
0:40
back home
