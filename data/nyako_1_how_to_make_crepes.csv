0:25
so when you're making crepes this is
0:27
what you need
0:29

0:34
flour wheat flour
0:39
and then milk
0:43
and salt this is salt but then if you
0:45
want to make your
0:47
crepes with um sugar yeah you can do it
0:50
but i mean
0:52
we like making it with salt
0:56
so let's start all you need
1:07
you need two hundred
1:10
meals of water
1:16
and 200 meals
1:23
of milk
1:31
[Music]
1:33
and then put in your eggs
1:43
so we are using two eggs
2:12
and then for the flour you have to use
2:15
two
2:16
cups or one cup or a half depending on
2:19
how many crepes you want to make for our
2:22
sake we are going to use the tablespoon
2:25
three of them four
2:32
and add some salt
2:35
for the salt you can put a half
2:39
table spoon
2:47
and then blend it
2:57
so this is our blender after putting
3:00
everything
3:01
if you don't have a blender you can use
3:04
a mixture
3:05
the one that they used to mix the dough
3:21
[Music]
3:29
so after blending it mixing it using a
3:32
blender
3:33
this is what you will have and leave it
3:36
please to settle for some few
3:38
minutes like three minutes so that the
3:41
bubbles can settle because when you make
3:44
it with the bubbles it won't
3:46
really feel nice always nice
3:50
so when you leave it to set up some time
3:53
get your flying pan and
3:56
put it on
4:06
heat it at a medium temperature
4:12
well your flour of the mixture is
4:15
settling down
