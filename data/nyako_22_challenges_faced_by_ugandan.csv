0:52
people it's not easy
0:55
so basically i've been on youtube this
0:58
is my
0:59

1:02
think it's my first
1:04
oh three weeks active yeah so i've been
1:07

1:16

1:26

1:28
like button up and subscribe
1:30
yeah so let's go into the challenges
1:32
first as i you went on youtube guys
1:35
you guys went um first routine
1:38
like my routine what what did i call it
1:42
that thing for that i will show you what
1:43
i
1:43
do for my skin to be like my skin
1:46
rotating yeah
1:47
anyway so let's go into the video
1:50
please i appreciate thank you for
1:53
watching my videos
1:54
anyway the challenge is challenge number
1:56
one it's better
1:57
you people data is expensive in uganda
2:01
like
2:02
i don't know like i don't know
2:05
very expensive imagine 1gb
2:08
it's at 5000 that's almost two dollars
2:11
just for 1gb and you're going to upload
2:14
a video
2:14
of um six minutes and it will take 2gb
2:18
that's that means 10 000 on there
2:21
imagine ten thousand on that and you
2:22
don't even have what to eat at it's
2:24
locked down
2:25
so that's the reason as to why you
2:26
should do it subscribe to my channel
2:28
because it's not easy so that is ten
2:30
thousand on only one video
2:32
or six minutes and that will have only
2:35
two views
2:37
your people challenges are for real
2:40
anyway
2:41
so that's challenge number one that's
2:43
exact challenge number two is the
2:44
network which is the network you people
2:47
need to work
2:48
anyways depends on where someone stays
2:51
and um
2:52
the type of uh telecom companies they're
2:55
using
2:55
so basically i use both m10 and airtel
2:58
but trust me
3:02
you can upload a video like at a
3:05
6 00 p.m in the evening and then it will
3:09
upload fully on your youtube channel
3:12
after five hours
3:14
five good hours you're there waiting for
3:16
the video to upload
3:18
and all your data and sometimes what is
3:21
so funny
3:22
you can upload it then it's it goes like
3:24
up to the midway like on fifty percent
3:27
upload then
3:28
it goes off it goes back again you cry
3:31
for your daughter you can cry for you
3:33
that's a trust me in them
3:34
those are all challenges that youtubers
3:36
in uganda are facing
3:38
so if you find any youtubers ugandan and
3:40
on this
3:42
youtube streets please subscribe because
3:44
they go through a lot
3:46
like i feel like they have to do to
3:49
like trace whatever these other
3:51
youtubers are doing you understand
3:53
yeah so that's another challenge it's um
3:56
this our first
3:57
piece let me not be quick to judge
4:00
but i'm supportive youtuber
4:04
other youtubers are like unsupportive
4:07
trust me you're going to do your video
4:10
and
4:11
tell them please i'm sorry so i've been
4:13
watching your youtube channel for this
4:16
long you have inspired me um
4:19
they'll be like okay thank you like
4:21
they're not going to motivate you i'm
4:23
going to tell you keep trying
4:25
because they basically want to be the
4:27
only youtubers
4:29
like only actually i just looked at that
4:32
i'm like god help me let people
4:34
subscribe to my channel like let them
4:36
subscribe my channel me i'll be there to
4:38
help anyone who wants because youtube is
4:41
like a wide platform for anyone we can
4:44
all fit there then why why
4:46
not wish the best for a new youtuber why
4:49
don't you have like to support your
4:51
fellow
4:52
ugandan like seriously that's why like
4:55
the kenyans that youtube gave me so high
4:57
because those people you people are good
4:59
you
4:59
make kenyan subscribers thank you very
5:01
much actually most of my first
5:03
subscribers have been kenyans
5:06
yeah you guys thank you thank you very
5:10
much
5:10
you really give me a reason to wake up
5:13
in the morning and get my camera
5:14
and then my phone my phone and then
5:17
shoot videos
5:19
but you are still in lockdown so after
5:21
the lockdown i promise to
5:23
be consistent like i'll even give you 10
5:26
videos like per week trust me
5:28
anyway so let's go to another challenge
5:30
like
5:32
so that was not supportive youtuber yeah
5:35
like these youtubers don't maybe a few
5:38
of them
5:39
that have not approached maybe but i
5:42
will try to let you guys know
5:44
i'll try and email them but have emailed
5:47
like
5:48
three youtubers which i want to mention
5:50
but trust me
5:52
okay not even only youtubers even these
5:54
other people like friends you can
5:56
send them your link for the youtube
5:58
channel and then they'd be like
6:00
nah okay they'll be like which i'll say
6:02
but then they don't subscribe because
6:03
when someone subscribe i get a
6:04
notification i get to know this one
6:06
so answer something but i don't and for
6:08
the few people who have subscribed thank
6:10
you very much like you guys
6:13
you're like please just watch my videos
6:16
and give me a thumbs up
6:17
anyway so here another thing that we
6:21
face
6:22
youtube is not really recognized by uh
6:24
it's not recognized by the
6:26
normal people it's just like if you are
6:28
not a celebrity
6:30
you don't have to be on youtube
6:31
basically to be organized for
6:32
celebrities to put their music
6:35
and movies but then if you're just a
6:38
normal you might
6:39
be doing your own things like vlogs
6:42
or anything it's it's really hard for
6:45
your band to come and watch your channel
6:47
so it's really okay i don't blame them
6:50
because the data is
6:51
very expensive because someone can be
6:53
using that of 2000
6:54
and then so what do you expect them like
6:57
do you even expect them to come and
6:58
watch a video
6:59
nine minutes so it's not really fair to
7:03
them also
7:04
and i really do understand that but i
7:06
hope in the future our data
7:09
managers will be relatively cheaper and
7:12
affordable for
7:13
people but they can watch our videos
7:15
anywhere
7:17
yeah so that's so sad charlie that's why
7:18
like you're gonna you know you can send
7:20
someone a link and they'll be like how
7:22
do they go on youtube like they've never
7:24
been on youtube
7:25
never so why what do you expect from
7:28
such a person
7:29
and you don't blame them that's how it
7:31
is so
7:32
another one so that one is like hi
7:34
youtube is not recognizing you kind of
7:36
like people don't know
7:37
it because um
7:41
that i'm like so expensive so people
7:45
don't really have to build their phone
7:46
go to youtube because
7:48
if you have your data is for whatsapp
7:49
and facebook you might have to pay tax
7:52
maybe instagram yeah but on youtube now
7:55
that's a challenge we are facing we
7:56
don't have like a lot
7:58
of people from uganda on youtube
8:00
watching our videos
8:03
[Music]
8:05
so another thing is um
8:11
what can i say we are in lockdown so we
8:15
are in lockdown like a total look down
8:17
you cannot go anywhere you just have to
8:19
be
8:19
in your house or around your
8:24
village everywhere but you cannot travel
8:26
kind of so we don't have like
8:28
travel vlogs now but with time i know
8:32
everything is going to be fine and i'll
8:34
be
8:34
giving you guys content so
8:38
i think that's what uh uh-huh another
8:40
thing before i forget
8:42
like you know you can come on youtube
8:44
you'll be like oh
8:45
i'm going to be editing my videos doing
8:48
this but then we don't have a skill some
8:50
people are like you take long to hold
8:52
that phone for yourself
8:54
like then you don't know anything about
8:56
that computer
8:57
oh my god like we have struggled you
9:00
people
9:01
you people we have struggled if you see
9:03
someone on youtube and there's a vendor
9:05
just subscribe subscribe my brother
9:09

9:15
