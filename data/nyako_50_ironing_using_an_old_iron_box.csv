0:00
to be careful with this thing because it
0:01
can open itself and then you burn your
0:04
clothes
0:07
[Music]
0:17

0:19

0:35
iron box it's called the iron box yeah
0:38
so
0:40
please if you have not yet subscribed to
0:41
this channel subscribe and hit the like
0:45
button and press the notification bell
0:47
so that every time i post a video you're
0:49
here to write with me so if you're going
0:51
to iron using the flat iron this is what
0:53
you first you have to clean it down here
0:56
here
0:58
use that soil like to clean it this is
1:00
what you do
1:02
the soil might be dirty but it cannot
1:04
stain
1:05
the cloth so you're going to see
1:08
how we do it here
1:10
in the village
1:20
that's how we do it
1:22
make sure it's clean there's no any
1:24
state down
1:29
so after doing this
1:32
we have to power down
1:36
the ash that we used last time this is
1:38
what we used yesterday
1:40
anyway ironing
1:42
so we have it clean
1:44
nothing there so we are going to put our
1:46
charcoal
1:48
charcoal inside and some fire
1:51
yeah
2:00
so you get charcoal
2:18
it's really hot i need to get something
2:20
to remove it
2:32
so this is how you put your fire
2:35
in the
2:36
iron box it's not called a flat iron
2:38
it's called the iron box i don't know
2:40
why
2:41
maybe because it's like a box and it's
2:44
metallic
2:45
it's not that flat so you have to put
2:47
back what you found
2:49
it's really hot
2:53
and then
3:00
so after when you put your fire you do
3:04
this
3:16
so you guys if you've watched my with my
3:18
previous videos you know that we have a
3:21
dining room or a dining hall so that's
3:23
where we do our ironing from
3:26
let's go there and we start the process
3:28
of ironing
3:41
this is how you aerate it
3:46
let's go ahead
4:01
[Music]
4:12
this
4:15
[Music]
4:22
[Music]
4:25
get your flashlights
4:32
[Music]
4:38
so this is how you clean down
4:54
we cleaned it from the soil so we have
4:57
to put it in water
4:59
a little bit
5:01
to clean it
5:04
and then
5:06
we can start
5:08
so this is how you do
5:13
so you can see a difference between the
5:17
side that is ironed
5:20
and the one that is not iron
5:24
you have to be careful with this thing
5:25
because it can open itself and then you
5:28
burn your clothes
5:31
[Music]
5:41
so you guys can see the difference here
5:43
and here
5:54
here
6:12
um
6:22
[Music]
6:28
so you can also sprinkle some water
6:31
like this
6:49
[ __ ] up
7:05
[Music]
7:11
um
7:16
[Music]
7:39
i don't know what she did
8:07
so you don't forget to sprinkle even
8:09
with a modern
8:11
flat irons they always have that
8:14
provision for water that you press and
8:16
you splash water so here
8:18
because we are using a manual thing you
8:20
just get water and
8:23
splash or sprinkle and then we put
8:28
what
8:31
ironing box
8:33
on it
8:34
and we are good to go
8:37
so you guys
8:39

8:42
everything is good to go
8:50
so you can see
8:53
all done well
8:56
using a flat iron
8:59
