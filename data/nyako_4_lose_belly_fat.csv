0:48
tummy what do you do to you know
0:52
so i decided to do a video and i show
0:55
you
0:55
what i do when i go to the gym it's
0:58
really not
1:00
hard but you have to
1:04
try and work out every time
1:07
like every day though i don't work out
1:09
every day but you can try and work out
1:11
every
1:12
day you have to choose exercises that
1:14
can
1:16
work on your belly like contract them
1:19
you understand there you understand
1:22
later
1:23
anyway so let's go into our video so i
1:26
use the border border to go to the gym
1:29
as you'll be seeing that
1:32
don't forget to subscribe you know
1:47
so i was on a buddha border recording
1:50
actually i would have had a walk
1:52
but as out of time so i had to take her
1:54
buddha buddha
1:55
but on my way going there a lot of
1:57
people were having their
1:58
evening walks and even jogging around
2:02
as you can see anyway
2:05
so this is a place it's called royal
2:08
seats
2:09
if you've been there in bukko lobby it's
2:12
really a
2:12
nice place where i like that gym
2:15
like they always have an instructor
2:19
and um people are
2:22
in there sounded like you can either
2:24
find one to two
2:26
only so you have your privacy and you
2:29
enjoy
2:30
actually we have reached now let's see
2:32
the side plus you can see the sign post
2:34
written on dolphin that's where we are
2:38
going to be working out from
2:40
so this is the reception the reception
2:42
is really nice you people
2:44
like very good i had to take a video
2:48
from there
2:50
anyway so let's go
2:53
in to their health club
3:16
it's
3:25
so my people this is the gym
3:29
but unfortunately we could not
3:32
find the gym instructor today because
3:34
it's um
3:36
it's his off day so we are unlucky
3:40
today we won't be doing the exact
3:43
things that we have to do for the
3:46
specific body parts that you want to
3:48
work
3:48
on but i can still
3:52
do one or two of my exercises then
3:55
i can call it a day but later i'll be
3:57
going to the steam
3:59
yeah so
4:03
this is what you can do to stretch your
4:05
belly
4:06
or your stomach you basically need to do
4:10
for 10 to 15 minutes
4:14
then you get up 10 to 15 minutes to turn
4:18
your back
4:19
so you stretch your belly on it
4:23
like it's so relaxing trust me when
4:25
you're doing
4:26
it like instead of doing a push-up or
4:29
sit-ups you can do them using this round
4:33
i don't know it's called a ball i don't
4:35
know how it is called
4:37
so but you can use that
4:40
how you can see no
4:43
i'm i'm not really
4:47
flexed enough but i could just
4:50
do you know when you don't have an
4:52
instructor you just do what you want so
4:56
basically i was doing to my comfort but
4:59
if it's a serious thing then you can
5:02
really do it seriously and it will work
5:04
for you i promise
5:05
so that's when i'm done with my belly so
5:08
i had to put my back
5:09
on it like that when you do that you
5:12
still stretch your belly
5:14
by putting your back on it like how you
5:17
can see
5:18
so that's what i got trust me it's so so
5:21
effective for your stomach muscles you
5:24
understand
5:26
so maybe you can try that but you can
5:28
even do that
5:29
at home on a mat like a workout mat
5:33
yeah so that is
5:36
me that's my stomach how you can see
5:39
it's like i have six packs comment below
5:42
if you think i have six packs
5:45
just tell me in the comments anyway
5:48
that's my body shape for now but i
5:51
promise to
5:51
work out and have a better
5:55
shape with time
6:07
[Music]
6:12
so i had to do it frequently like
6:15
consistently for some minutes
6:19
though i've not posted everything but i
6:21
tried so it was like a play time just
6:23
about
6:23
you know how it feels when you're
6:24
bouncing on it it's really nice so
6:27
that's the body still
6:29
comment below if you think i have a body
6:32
goal
6:39
[Music]
7:29
so i had to continue with my exercise as
7:32
you can see
7:35
so you can keep on increasing
7:38
the speed how fast you want to keep
7:42
running
7:46
it's really so safe
7:50
better than running like on the roadside
7:52
where there is
7:53
dust and then people so
7:57
i prefer to do it in the gym but then
7:59
the only disadvantage of the gym
8:02
it might be cost full like it's
8:05
expensive
8:06
but then on the road you won't have to
8:09
pay for
8:10
anything so maybe that's why
8:14
someone will opt
8:17
for the road to have an evening walk but
8:21
then
8:22
in the gym it's easier convenient
8:25
and relaxed like there's no one to
8:29
bother you
8:30
there's no one looking at you oh my god
9:08
as you can see now i kept on increasing
9:11
and reducing the volume
9:13
like i decreased it when i felt like oh
9:15
i've gone so so fast then i could
9:17
decrease then when i feel like yeah
9:19
relax then i can
9:21
increase that the
9:24
i hear the volume i could increase the
9:27
speed
9:28
anyway so that is the gym is really a
9:32
huge place
9:33
and nice the sun can so
9:36
here i was now done and finalizing my
9:39
exercises
9:40
uh what you have to know about working
9:43
out when you're beginning you have to
9:44
start at a slow
9:46
what can i say like at slow pace then
9:49
you keep on increasing
9:51
increasing until you reach to the
9:55
maximum speed that you want and then you
9:58
start reducing
9:59
and reducing when you're now coming to
10:02
the end of your workout
10:03
so basically here i was done
10:06
and then just chilling then i can
10:09
go to the steam bath thank you
10:23
so here basically i was done with
10:25
everything and showered
10:27
and then that was the changing room
10:31
so i would recommend you people to try
10:35
out that place too
10:36
yeah please subscribe to my channel and
10:40
give me
10:41
a like and comment please
10:44
love you
