[Music]
1:01
so this is our second dress for today
1:03
it's a mini
1:05
black dress very short
1:09
you can wear this for dinner a date
1:12
depending on where you're going you can
1:14
even have it for
1:16
evening walk around the park
1:19
depending on where you stay so it's
1:23
cotton short sleeve
1:26
as you can see and that's the back part
1:30
of it so comfortable
1:35
you feel confident so you can add in
1:38
some accent a third dress
1:40
it's a black plain dress
1:44
um you can wear this dress for a
1:46
corporate dinner
1:49
your date dinner or
1:53
just a casual girl's day out
1:57
or clapping by now you can go with this
1:59
place in a club
2:01
what i like about this dress is so
2:05
comfy and
2:08
the secret is behind it's a bare back
2:11
dress
2:12
so you don't need a bra that's what
2:15
makes it unique you have to wear it
2:17
without the bra
2:24
it's a little bit elastic
2:27
not cotton and not silky so
2:30
but has a nice feeling
2:35
this is our fourth dress dress number
2:37
four if you like it
2:38
comment dress number four so this time
2:41
this dress
2:43
it has no much detail on it like about
2:46
it but still
2:47
it has a little revealing about like the
2:50
behind part
2:52
if you know me you know that i like any
2:54
dress that reveal the skin
2:56
so that's why most of the dresses we
2:58
have been trying on reveal the skin
3:00
so this is for a corporate dinner but
3:03
the
3:04
any nice function that you can attend
3:06
i'm a fan of black so that's why i'm
3:07
wearing black dresses
3:09
you can't even attend church in this
3:12
dress
3:13
it's a decent dress
3:17
nice and elegant yeah
3:20
so that's the behind of that dress i
3:23
want
3:24
but uh-huh yeah you don't have to put in
3:26
a bra because when you wear it and then
3:28
the bra is showing here like revealing
3:30
it won't look nice to kill the look of
3:33
the dress
3:34
so basically i prefer wearing it without
3:36
a bra
3:37
so here we go braless
3:42
and that's the look for our dress
3:47
okay for the lovers of long dresses
3:51
here we finally get one long dress
3:54
this dress it's a silk dress
4:00
can wear this at a beach you can wear
4:02
this for cocktail party
4:05
and it has a long sleeves
4:08
actually this what makes me love it i'm
4:10
not a fan of long dresses but i just
4:12
love this just because of that
4:14
long sleeve here that reveal the skin
4:19
so you can wear it without
4:22
a bra or with a bra and another question
4:26
what makes me like it like you can just
4:28
remove the arms
4:30
just like this and makes it a sleeveless
4:34
like that or do this
4:38
basically you can get creative with this
4:40
dress do this just make it a design
4:45
so here we go and then you move
4:51
and then you can cover or make it really
4:55
it depends on what you want to do is a
4:58
very simple dress and elegant still
5:03
you can have a beach work like other
5:05
choice
5:06
with it
5:09
let's got so this is dress number six
5:12
and the last dress of the day
5:15
if you like just the basics please
5:17
comment below
5:20
this one is basically a club dress like
5:23
you can
5:24
go with it or a
5:27
patty i prefer wearing this dress at
5:31
night because it's so
5:32
shiny and sparkly that's the back of the
5:36
dress
5:41
but it's a two-way dress you can either
5:43
put this at the back
5:45
or put this in front it doesn't matter
5:48
you can put any sign
5:52
anywhere it doesn't have like a bag or a
5:54
front
5:56
then then get it so
6:00
