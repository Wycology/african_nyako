0:35
my camera is not doing the justice but
0:39
i'm trying
1:34
so
1:42
[Music]
2:15
[Applause]
2:20
okay this is our sunrise
2:22
it's always
2:24
very orange in the morning when the sun
2:26
is rising but
2:28
my camera is not doing justice for you
2:30
guys
2:32

i'm trying
2:59
so
3:02
it's always hot
3:05
from 8 00 a.m
3:08
so this is like the coolest time in our
3:10
village
3:12
this time it's like the coolest because
3:15
it's
3:16
the sun is just rising
3:18
i think pakwash is the hottest place in
3:21
uganda
3:24
it's very hot
3:31
so people are going to the garden this
3:33
early morning you can see
3:39
some people really dig very
3:42
far
3:43
so they have to use a body of water to
3:45
go there
3:46
and other people walk like the lady
3:49
there
3:50
she has a hoe
3:52
on her head and the girl can carry water
3:55
that she will be drinking
3:58
that's the water i think i like taking
4:01
pictures of this our neighbor's house
4:10
the buds you guys can see the birds
4:12
there
4:14
actually they always make fun of us like
4:16
there's this type of stereotype that we
4:19
people from the northern part of uganda
4:21
eat birds so it's really hard to find a
4:24
bad flag but i've just seen two of them
4:27
flying all three
4:35
so this time of the year you already see
4:37
people carrying
4:39
crops from the garden because it's
4:41
harvesting time
4:43
crabs from the garden you guys you can't
4:46
see this well
4:48
like my phone cannot do justice
4:52
