0:56
go okay this is the place
1:00
it's called one leg
1:02
so yeah welcoming us to one glacier so
1:05
one one lei is basically ajahnam wide
1:09
meaning the place where the axe is
1:13
yeah or located so something like that
1:15
so this is basically about the lewis
1:18
solus of
1:20
one of the groups in uganda that is the
1:23
nikki group
1:25
in uganda
1:26
samia malua so we have lewis in uganda
1:29
lewis in kenya they were in south sudan
1:31
and ethiopia
1:33
but for me i'm a liver from uganda here
1:35
under my journal but then i'm going to
1:38
be sharing with you guys a little bit
1:40
about this history the separation point
1:43
of vietnam our ancestors please join me
1:47
let's go
1:50
so this picture here
1:53
the picture
1:54
tells us
1:56
that these are like two groups of people
1:59
and we are seeing a river problem this
2:01
is the river here
2:03
the white nail
2:05
and then there is an axe here so this is
2:09
what happened here this is one group
2:11
probably the actually
2:13
and then this is the rule alone where i
2:16
come from so these are the two brothers
2:19
who we are fighting we're going to see
2:21
why they were fighting and why did they
2:23
separate
2:24
so as you can see this one and the wife
2:27
this side and this one
2:28
and the other people and i love the
2:30
other side so it means a separation here
2:34
so what they're telling us here they're
2:36
like um
2:37
at the heart of the lower culture one
2:39
lane has maintained its symbolic
2:41
function as a source of ethnic identity
2:44
for the lower people
2:46
a vast ethnic group occupying part of
2:49
uganda the democratic republic of congo
2:52
kenya and south sudan so that is where
2:54
the lower people are
2:57
this is a place where possibly five or
2:59
six
3:00
centuries ago the king's
3:03
two sons so the kings two sun is deep
3:05
and
3:08
the king's two sons and the newer
3:10
founding figures mapil and labongo
3:13
separated following a fight and took
3:15
different directions symbolized by the
3:18
throwing of an axe into the river that's
3:21
separated it's water
3:23
really the dog has a parrot i don't know
3:26
what i got today
3:28
so the place the real exact place is
3:30
just under that tree i think you guys
3:32
can see that
3:34
so when you come here during a very dry
3:37
season
3:38
it's believed that
3:39
you can see the axe that anax is still
3:42
there but i've never seen it and we have
3:45
not phoned the tour guide here to tell
3:47
us more but then all the details are
3:50
still here i'm going to be reading
3:52
this is so helpful to the lord you know
3:55
like
3:56
you're already
3:58
anyway
3:59
so
4:00
yeah where are we
4:02
so they fought and took different
4:04
directions symbolized by throwing of an
4:06
axe into the river separated its water
4:09
the brothers vote
4:11
no longer to fight
4:14
after taking a reconciliation meal this
4:17
separation resulted into the question of
4:20
several ethnic law subgroups
4:23
particularly the allure
4:27
i think my trade
4:29
now living on the western bank of the
4:33
nile this is us in the western bank like
4:36
we are at the west nile so yeah
4:39
and then
4:40
and surely now on the opposite bank so
4:44
when you say across there when you drive
4:47
like 22 kilometers you start meeting the
4:50
actually tribe so those people it means
4:52
they separated there actually we speak
4:55
almost the same language but our accent
4:57
is this is a bit difficult like
5:00
different and we have similar words but
5:03
we pronounce them differently so when
5:05
you cross this river and you go the
5:07
other side
5:08
those are the
5:13
so basically this history it's like it
5:15
was written
5:16
it happened long time ago but still we
5:18
have evidence to back it up things are
5:20
still happening everything they are
5:22
telling us here it's still the way it is
5:25
so the actually leave the other side
5:27
across the river and friends is here
5:38
okay
6:13
okay
6:19
[Music]
6:26
this is the fish that we have got
6:30
fresh from the river
6:37
movement
6:56
so we have got some fish here but let's
6:58
continue with our video we cut it short
7:00
because of the fish we wanted to get
7:02
fish for our dinner
7:05
here we are called
7:07
people we stay at the river so we eat
7:10
fish some step of food
7:12
anyway guys let's
7:14
continue so i'm going to tell you the
7:17
story
7:19
the story of the villain that bong was a
7:21
parishioned poet so basically we had two
7:23
brothers this is the pilgrim and their
7:25
father was alone
7:28
so one time
7:31
they failed okay we are like the lower
7:33
we migrated from baltimore so that's the
7:36
last place that
7:38
we are believed to come from
7:40
but our origin is not yet clear
7:44
it's not yet clear but we migrated from
7:46
bahrain
7:47
in south sudan
7:49
yeah we had happily settled and lived
7:52
there and then we had to come here
7:54
and we stayed at the maximum falls so
7:57
this is like the game park after
8:00
so this is where we step up which means
8:02
a place where leopards stay in english
8:05
but in my language quite where they live
8:07
stay so before our ancestors came here
8:10
this place was occupied by the lower
8:11
part
8:12
only
8:13
then we also came
8:15
and settled
8:16
so
8:17
one time
8:20
the pill the pill had the hunting spear
8:23
and that a little an elephant came
8:26
like at their neighborhood so when the
8:28
elephant came
8:30
la bongo got that spear got his brother
8:33
spear
8:34
and pierced
8:35
an elephant but the elephant ran
8:38
with a spear
8:40
and the brother came he's like where is
8:42
my spear he's like um the elephant went
8:45
with this
8:46
he's like i want my spear and i want it
8:49
today
8:50
so he was like okay let me go look for
8:52
the what for an elephant so i prepared
8:55
this journey and he told his brother
8:57
when i don't come back
9:00
just
9:01
beat the drums like the royal drums and
9:03
tell everyone in my community that i'm
9:05
dead but if i get your spear well i'm
9:08
good i'll be back
9:10
so he made pekka pacquiao they're like
9:12
small cow peas
9:14
we use them up now like if if your
9:17
daughter gets getting married their
9:19
aunties make the applique and give as a
9:22
present to them like gifts the in-laws
9:25
so he made he prepared pekka for himself
9:28
just to be eating on like snacks because
9:30
he never knew i was going to meet the
9:32
elephant to get his brother's spear
9:34
so he moved along
9:36
and looked for the space but every place
9:39
that he was going he could name that
9:40
place according to the experience
9:43
he faces there so he could give a place
9:45
her name anaka there's a germany all
9:48
those places we are named by him so
9:51
afterwards he got this we got some lady
9:53
there and the lady gave him a spear so
9:55
he came back to the story early like
9:57
written here but i cannot read
9:58
everything for you guys
10:00
it will take so long and you guys will
10:02
be born so when he got a spear i came
10:04
back and he presented the spirit with a
10:06
brother
10:07
but some lady had given him
10:10
the west beads and the uncle ankulates
10:13
so when he come with those things
10:16
his brother's baby played with them and
10:18
then swallowed one so when the brother
10:21
so we are i'm telling this story to
10:23
reach at the separation point why did
10:25
they say parrot that's why i'm telling
10:27
you the story
10:28
so
10:30
his
10:30
brother rabon's kid took his bead and
10:34
swallowed it then he's like you made me
10:36
work for
10:38
years to look for your spear so i also
10:40
need my bead and it's like but my kid
10:43
has just followed the beard how what
10:44
will i donate no get it so they got the
10:48
baby and cut her stomach and removed the
10:51
bean from the baby's intestine
10:54
and then he presented a bit to the boys
10:56
like okay my brother this is your bit
10:58
but i've just killed my kid i don't
11:00
think we can be brothers anymore we got
11:03
an axe he came under that tree
11:06
yeah
11:07
and then
11:09
put the axe there like this this is
11:11
going to be our separation point from
11:14
today stay with your people and anyone
11:17
willing to follow me let's go
11:19
there they went across and started their
11:23
nation their tribe that is they actually
11:26
and
11:27
other trades there and then the other
11:30
one the spear guy remained here
11:32
and became our ancestor
11:35
yeah so basically that is it we are all
11:38
one people we are all lures
11:40
and then the ones that went became louis
11:43
in kenya it was in tanzania so that's
11:46
why i always tell you that the laws in
11:47
kenya like where the first people better
11:50
than we continue so you guys came from
11:52
us
11:53
you should know that um so here this
11:58
picture or a portrait okay this picture
12:00
portrays
12:02
the separation point that's an axe up to
12:05
today if you're separating with someone
12:08
which when you disagree with someone and
12:10
you want to separate you can get an axe
12:12
and be like here we separate i'm not
12:15
your relative anymore so that's why they
12:17
use an x
12:19
and this is this this is the river here
12:22
yeah you guys i think that is it thank
12:24
you very much for watching guys because
12:26
i hope this is so educative i hope this
12:28

12:29

12:32
and culture
12:34
that's it for today let me go and eat
12:36
