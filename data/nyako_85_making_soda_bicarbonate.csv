you're here
0:35
with me so today
0:38
so today i'm going to show you guys how
0:40
we make our
0:42
soda by carbonate so basically we use
0:46
soda by carbonate to cook our food it's
0:48
a catalyst so it makes food like beans
0:52
and our greens the ones that
0:55
they're called they're called um
0:58
in english in my language they are
1:01
called the cheek so in english it's a
1:03
leafy okra so we always apply um
1:07
soda bicarbonate in them and the pincer
1:10
they can cook faster and they don't
1:13
consume a lot of fire with all shampoo
1:15
so today i'm going to show you how we
1:17
basically make it so what you need
1:20
first
1:22
we need this this is a bowel that we
1:24
will use to collect the liquid so this
1:26
is the soda bicarbonate in a liquid form
1:29
that we are going to make
1:30
and then this i'm going to cut it and
1:33
then i'll use it for distillation if
1:36
that's the right one
1:39
and then the water
1:41
so
1:42
this is the mesh boxer i think i should
1:45
put it here
1:52
so this one
1:53
remainders of the simsil
1:56
like when you get a simpson out of it
1:58
