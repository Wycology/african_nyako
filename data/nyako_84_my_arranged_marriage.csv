welcome back to my youtube channel in
0:02
case you're new please subscribe anyway
0:04
i don't really like i didn't have a
0:06
video to post did i anyway so yesterday
0:10
i was busy and then even at night i
0:12
wanted to video for you guys what you
0:14
have been doing like what we are doing
0:16
at night but i felt because there was no
0:18
light so basically here at some times we
0:22
do arranged marriages in my society but
0:26
it's not
0:27
like it's not like a must if you want
0:30
they can make for you around marriage
0:32
but if you can get your partner by
0:34
yourself it's also okay
0:37
so i have my brother here
0:40
the son to my dad's
0:42
brother
0:44
he
0:45
was
0:46
like they got for him a woman to marry
0:49
so basically it's arranged marriages
0:51
for its arranged marriage so we went
0:54
there at night to see the lady so they
0:57
called us that they have got a lady
1:00
so
1:01
no no
1:02
so you guys i'll be showing you i'll be
1:05
inserting the video that we took
1:06
yesterday at night here
1:09
i'm
1:10
i hope you'll be able to see
1:12
when they are
1:14
seeing each other so that wasn't light
1:17
but you have to use a touch for the lady
1:19
to see the gentleman
1:21
and also the gentleman to see the lady
1:24
then they can decide if
1:26
they can go ahead
1:29
to
1:30
date each other
1:32
yeah
1:33
so basically today we are expecting her
1:35
to come at home
1:37
when she comes
1:39
then i'll show you guys maybe our video
1:43
when she's coming at our home
1:45
yeah so
1:48
if she comes in our video but if she
1:50
doesn't come then i won't post this
1:52
video
1:55
this baby is crying so i have to go and
1:57
attend to him he wants to take breakfast
2:00
because he hasn't eaten
2:02
so at night we had to go at their home
2:05
okay not really there humble them middle
2:08
man who was connecting two of them
2:11
so we had to go there we ah we are going
2:14
through the dark you people you can't
2:16
see because it's dark so we had to go at
2:18
their place and then meet the lady
2:20
before we allow her to come at her home
2:23
so that time is like them seeing each
2:26
other for this first time and deciding
2:27
to move on or not
2:30
with the dating
2:31
so we reached there when we wish they
2:33
had to see each other it was dark so you
2:35
have to basically put light into the
2:38
guy's face for the lady to see and then
2:40
light up the lady's face also with a
2:42
touch for the guy to see then they can
2:45
decide if they're going to
2:47
see each other the next day for another
2:50
step or not so basically i'd suggested
2:53
five ladies for him to choose one
2:56
but he decided to take this one to meet
2:59
up with this one so basically this was
3:01
his choice i think
3:04
yeah
3:04
and he doesn't like a lady with that
3:07
facial hair so there are people who wear
3:09
a weave so it doesn't like with the legs
3:11
someone with natural hair
3:13
short hair
3:15
dark skinned so that's what basically
3:17
wanted and this girl was one of that
3:20
with the qualities
3:23
so this is my brother and is waiting for
3:26
the woman to come
3:27

yeah my brother is so excited you can't
4:41
wait to have the lady how old is she
4:45
so we didn't ask how old she is but
4:47
she's young i think she's like 18 or 19
4:50
years
4:52
and how old are you
4:54
you how old are you
5:01
30 years
5:03

5:10
soon then we shall do other ceremonies
5:12
right
5:13
we have to do that we have to pay down
5:37
so we had me and the kids like the twins
5:40
and my cousin also here we had to go and
5:43
greet the visitors that are already
5:45
coming to
5:47
the house so there they are you have to
5:50
come inside and greet them
5:53
we didn't sell much we just created them
5:55
off our hand to greet all of them
5:59
so
6:00
there is our bread to be there she is
6:06
she beautiful i think she's very
6:08
beautiful
6:11
yeah so that was it
6:18
so the bride cannot come my lunchrooms
6:20
come with a young sister and an elder
6:22
sister so that's why there are three of
6:24
them but the elder sister just given
6:25
back so she has a baby with her
6:29
yeah let's go and wait for evening
6:31
chicken
6:34
after us greeting uh the
6:36
man also had to go and greet us
6:40
our other cousins they had to go and see
6:43
so the guy is going to see
6:45
his bride
6:46
during this was yesterday he saw him
6:50
sorry he saw her at night so this is the
6:53
first time he is seeing that lady during
6:57
day so those are
6:58
those guys are from the ladies family
7:00
not really family but the
7:02
the middle man's family so they also
7:05
came and the other people are going to
7:07
eat today's chicken
7:09
oh my god you guys i don't think it's
7:11
making sense what i'm saying but it's
7:13
our culture so
7:15
yeah so they are there i'm not going to
7:16
video them all so i'm just giving you a
7:19
clue of what is happening and leaving
7:21
them to speak to themselves they are
7:23
going to talk about whatever is
7:24
happening but i'm not going to video
7:26
everything i need to leave them with
7:28
their privacy so the lady when the guy
7:30
comes she has to act shy i don't know if
7:32
she's shy but she has been acting shy
7:35
like covering her face
7:37
every time the guy comes in so he has
7:40
already seen the lady so i'm going to
7:42
ask him how has he found the lady is the
7:44
lady beautiful is that what he expected
7:54
so you guys like i talked to him and
7:58
it's like the lady is cute and basically
8:01
i'm going to start dating okay it's not
8:03
like dating she's just going to get
8:05
married to
8:06
him
8:07
directly so today we are going to give a
8:10
chicken she will slaughter chicken and
8:12
then cook for the guy's
8:14
family then the guy's mom
8:17
will
8:18
tell if she's a good cook and then she
8:21
has to wake up every morning and boil
8:24
water for bathing for me
8:28
the guy's mother a guy's father and
8:30
other relatives
8:32
oh my god like he's really tired i'm
8:34
like she has to wake up very early in
8:35
the morning sweep the compound basically
8:37
do all the house shows
8:39
and even boil
8:41
bathing water for everyone like the
8:43
elders in the home
8:45
and then remember she's cooking the
8:47
chicken but she's not eating the chicken
8:49
like she doesn't have to eat chicken
8:51
until
8:52
some good times i think up to when she
8:54
gets pregnant like she conceives when
8:57
she consists then
8:59
the father-in-law will buy for her one
9:01
whole chicken and then will tell her
9:04
from today now you can eat chicken in
9:06
this home so that's how the tradition is
9:09
like this
9:10
that's our culture some people practice
9:13
it some people don't so
9:16
actually maybe i will um
9:18
because
9:20
maybe i'll update you guys with time but
9:23
let me just upload this video up to here
9:26
so the guys will be going for work and
9:28
there they are taking for the ladies tea
9:30
now
9:32
to take to drink so basically the guy
9:36
has confirmed that she likes the ladies
9:38
so they're going to give transport to
9:39
the other two ladies that came with her
9:42
to go back and she will remain and then
9:45
after some days
9:46
her family like the boys in our family
9:49
will come at our home and eat chicken
9:51
it's also a traditional because i don't
9:53
know how to say it but
9:55
they'll come and eat chicken here and
9:57
then definitely she will be married here
9:59
then they'll negotiate dow array
10:02
yeah but i think i'll be updating you
10:04
guys whatever it's coming through time
10:06
for diary i will also video whatever i
10:09
can video because i kind of promise that
10:11
i can video everything but i can video
10:14
what i can
10:16
yeah so
10:17

10:18

10:21

10:23
