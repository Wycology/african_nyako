0:24
after a long day of work what you have
0:27
to do
0:28
calm fresh water go cook dinner
0:32
or supper then you shower and then you
0:35
go
0:35
to bed as you'll be seeing
0:39
in the video so this water is used for
0:43
all the domestic use
0:45
like cooking drinking yes drinking this
0:48
is water they take
0:50
and bathing like basically everything at
0:53
home
0:54
we use this water it's a running water
0:58
not that safe for drinking but we still
1:01
drink it
1:02
so then after when you finish what i
1:04
have to get um
1:06
attached i don't know how it's cold in
1:08
english but you have to get like
1:10
something soft
1:11
to place on your head then you can put
1:14
the gel can
1:14
on top of it yeah so that you don't feel
1:18
the pressure of the jericho so that's
1:20
what basically she's doing i don't know
1:24
how it's called in english but in my
1:26
language it's called otashi
1:29
yeah such as to roll it like that
1:31
basically you can use grass
1:33
or a piece of cloth to make that
1:45
and then carry the jericho to your
1:48
hey that's a 20 litre jericho so it's
1:51
really heavy
1:53
but it's the everyday routine
1:57
so basically she's used
2:04
so she carries it straight to the head
2:07
make sure
2:08
it's not leaking on her body and then
2:10

9:50
colleagues
9:51

9:54
talking about
9:55
so telling her to hit its head so that
9:57
like it doesn't
9:59
poison her or bite her so that's what
10:03
everyone was like talking about
10:07
