1:23
so steve how has been your experience in
1:25
uganda and
1:26
when did you come to uganda i came to
1:29
uganda last year that was around
1:31
october but i can say uganda is a very
1:36
free country and a very friendly country
1:38
and uganda what i can
1:40
not fail to mention is that there's
1:42
plenty of food a lot of food
1:47
no no no not like there's nobody but in
1:50
terms of food
1:52
like there's a lot of food in uganda so
1:54
what is your favorite
1:55
food in uganda so far since i came i
1:58
like uh
1:58
matakoke jean at first
2:02
one yeah i call it vinegar okay
2:06
anyway let's continue with the video
2:09
so what we are going to do um
2:12
we all know that the luau either part of
2:15
the nail
2:16
the river nail river lake nail tips
2:20
yeah so in uganda we have tribes like
2:23
allude
2:24
journal that is my tribe i mean i'm from
2:27
parkwatch
2:28
and we have a choli and then we have
2:30
language and
2:31
pandoras those are the luau tribes in
2:34
uganda so you're going to tell me about
2:35
the lord tribes in kenya
2:46
so he knows in kenya
2:50
they have jello jello tribes i have
2:52
tried no idea
2:55
is it's basically like the community you
2:57
say that we are lures that we call
2:58
ourselves
2:59
so what tribe are you in kenya in kenya
3:05
so we have other laws in southern sudan
3:07
i don't know how they are called
3:09
and we have some laws in ethiopia so
3:12
basically i'll talk about the laws in
3:14
uganda because that's what i know
3:16
and he will be helping me with the lures
3:19
in kenya
3:20
the januarys so
3:24
we can continue by um
3:27
we're just going to find out how they
3:30
call words i'm going to say a word in
3:33
english then you tell me how they
3:34
pronounce it or how they
3:36
say it in their language then i will
3:37
tell you how we say it in your name but
3:39
for my case i'll say it in all the laws
3:42
in uganda that is your name
3:52
so but me i'll just use the four
3:53
languages because that's
3:56
what i know best i speak all the
3:58
languages by the
3:59
apache from japan anyway let's continue
4:03
so
4:03
steve you're going to tell me how you
4:04
call god in yolo
4:08
god uh god you know a language called
4:11
nasai
4:12
yes i first got it in allure it's called
4:14
in um actually it's lobana
4:19
in um learning is the same i think
4:22
if not then you can correct me but as
4:24
far as i know it's also lubanga
4:27
yeah so basically if if he says
4:30
say i would not get it though we are all
4:32
low you understand
4:34
i'll not get it so that's maybe the
4:36
difference
4:37
in that then a house how do you call a
4:39
house
4:41
a house we call it art or tia even us
4:44
our house is called
4:46
art then our home is called gang i don't
4:48
know about you
4:49
there's a difference between a house and
4:51
a home a home is called
4:52
we call it dala
4:57
i hope it's called gang then in a
5:00
lore that's done in your name then
5:02
allure
5:03
it's called pasho i don't know if
5:05
inaudible it's called yeah
5:06
that's even as you can still fight you
5:08
but
5:14
that's how you call it you also call it
5:16
courthouse and then in the
5:18
in louisville in in kenya there's uh
5:20
other tribes like i think in organize
5:26
something like that yeah i think i've
5:28
had that thing also
5:30
yeah i don't know which lower call it's
5:32
just yours yeah
5:34
so yeah not so far then the problem
5:58
something like that and you people
6:01
as i think we call it band or
6:04
auduma
6:10
that sounds like bantu so i don't really
6:12
know
6:13
anyway so that was in kenya please maize
6:16
it's called that maggie if it's boiled
6:18
it's called anoegema
6:19
boga as we call it the one that is
6:23
boiled is called
6:24
banda bokeh and then
6:29
the one that is roasted is called
6:31
bandung
6:32
panda
7:00
a boy
7:03
[Music]
7:06
[Applause]
7:08
i think someone who was listening to our
7:10
language i wanted to tell you guys
7:12
just didn't take time to hear say saying
7:15
why he said
7:18

7:20
passion like when i know when you speak
7:22

7:24
you're struggling yeah i just say wait
7:26
oh it's like you're telling someone
7:47
the southern part they can say hero

9:22

9:39
how is your day coming
9:40
[Music]

9:49

9:54
okay let's continue so you have to say
9:55
we then at night
9:57
good night you need marbella
10:00
that's like a kid learning to speak
10:02
don't you know me say it mean my bear
10:04
you said with my best
10:08
so no the old man is there we know that
10:10
everything is okay
10:12
yeah but that's similar like you got if
10:14
you tell it someone who is from
10:18
[Music]
10:22
from kenya just go to the northern part
10:25
of uganda and west nile
10:26
just speak your language they will take
10:28
like 50 percent of it then they will
10:30
know what your meaning you understand
10:32
yeah so how do you call money
10:35
money money is better
10:42
you call it
10:47
[Music]
11:00
[Laughter]
11:10
that is allure if i'm not mistaken you
11:13
can comment below
11:14
and tell me and then you said you call
11:17
it person
11:18
we call it okay it's also pesa
11:21
yeah so the padola is like so in japan
11:25
i think the only one that i know in the
11:50
okay so we're going to common practices
11:53
like why do you think you people
11:55
practice and we also do it in yoga and
11:57
that has a lower community
11:58
so you're going to tell me how you do
12:01
first of all marriage like how do you
12:02
guys marry
12:04
i think marriage is all about agreeing
12:07
and praying already
12:09
so it's like based on community
12:12
family background can your parents tell
12:15
you not to marry
12:16
certain tribes or not not to marry
12:18
someone
12:20
definitely all tribes uh there's always
12:22
that
12:23
there's always a stereotype that is
12:25
associated with that particular trial
12:27
i don't want to be to be tribal in this
12:29
like to mention each community with
12:31
maybe something that a disadvantage on
12:33
but uh just like because of uh political
12:37
alignment and different
12:39
uh political rivalry you find like most
12:42
most community i'm sorry even in kenya
12:44
people are aligned as part
12:46
as for the tribe so those stereotypes
12:47
whereby some parents can discourage you
12:49
to money from other trades
12:51
which should not be the case i think we
12:52
should okay first yeah i think it's
12:54
so diverse like it doesn't matter from
12:57
which tribe you're
12:58
getting married to but there's still
13:02
stereotype they tell you don't marry the
13:04
stripers they eat people don't go to
13:06
these people because they do this but
13:07
then i think that's
13:08
those are just like meat like it's not
13:10
true a misconception
13:12
yeah so if you can't marry anyone and
13:14
then now how
13:15
barry of ceremonies for us we are
13:18
barriers we don't take like for low like
13:20
a long period of time one day is today
13:22
for man it will take like four days then
13:25
for a woman five days
13:27
comment below if i'm talking the truth
13:29
if you're in vietnam
13:31
oh i'll do it tell me so you people so
13:34
with us it's different
13:37
we believe in giving the last respect if
13:39
somebody wants to also
13:40
do that but he does four days there's no
13:43
way like uh
13:44
i climbed under and then we just send
13:46
him away in three days we must do
13:48
like uh we must gather his morning
13:50
people must moan
13:51
until now they're ready to release him
13:53
to burn to go and rest
13:55
so our vital arrangements it always
13:57
depends on so many factors
13:58
maybe there's a availability maybe
14:00
somebody was working didn't have a house
14:02
they need to put up a house for him
14:03
because before he's buried
14:05
uh maybe if uh let's say
14:10
if a person dies he's a prominent person
14:12
that he has got
14:13
family outside they need to come up
14:14
together for the barrier so it all
14:16
depends
14:17
it also depends with that somewhere
14:18
whether somebody has died at home
14:20
somebody
14:20
it's not preserved in the mutuality if
14:22
it dies at home it can take like three
14:24
days and then the person is
14:25
the person inspired prior to to
14:27
treatment before
14:31
no in that i don't know it cannot take
14:33
to eat definitely but at the moment
14:35
it can take two weeks they want to okay
14:37
someone said if someone
14:39
passes on so someone can be treated and
14:42
put it down more sharing
14:43
then you guys continue with your normal
14:44
life no we don't continue the normal
14:46
life we
14:47
be preparing for the barriers we make
14:49
arrangements yeah okay
14:50
yeah and the traditional dances do you
14:52
guys have your traditional dancers
14:54
like do you yeah yeah like for the
14:57
allure
14:58
okay jonah i don't really differentiate
15:01
a lot but miami
15:02
nam we have uh we have
15:06
conge that's our traditional dance
15:10
we have um another we have a longbow
15:14
and others
15:19
yeah and i'll do another video dancing
15:22
all those dances if you want just
15:23
subscribe to my youtube channel and you
15:25
will see
15:26
that so do you guys have traditional
15:28
dances yeah we have we have ramongi for
15:30
for men and then we have what does dance
15:32
for so women don't just like me
15:36
yeah it depends with the like mostly
15:39
ramona dance
15:40
it was mostly played by it was mostly
15:42
danced by by the men
15:44
and then we have got the daughter the
15:46
daughter dances for
15:47
for women do you so do now to this
15:51
your traditional dance yeah i know you
15:53
dance with her
15:55
like me
15:58
that is like eastern uganda's dance
16:01
that's not
16:02
but once we used our legs
16:05
anyway so we are going to talk about the
16:08
facts about the use
16:09
all the misconceptions about the lures
16:12
like what do people think i'm going to
16:13
share with you what people
16:14
think here you're going about the lures
16:16
then you can share with me
16:18
what people think about the louis in
16:20
kenya so basically
16:22
here they think that we have a defined
16:26
look we all look the same you have to be
16:28
tall
16:29
dark skinned and thin thin one
16:32
thicker one like if you don't have
16:34
figure one my dear you're not a luo
16:36
you have to be straight no bad no
16:38
anything straight that's you
16:40
i'm very tall if you're short you're not
16:43
telling
16:44
anyone that you know if you're light
16:45
skinned you have to have like a darker
16:48
completion very dark
16:49
that's that's the conception about the
16:51
louisiana you have to look like that
16:53
it's about you people
16:55
with us uh i think the
16:58
the women are almost distinguished like
17:00
if you look at a woman coming from a
17:02
distance
17:03
you just know that that's the lure we
17:05
have our style
17:07
we have got a nice body shape little
17:09
ladies are known to be carved and
17:11
hot with nice
17:13
[Music]
17:16
what happened to that noise in yoga and
17:19
the men they're tall duck and ransom
17:21
just like me
17:28
eye for anyway here you go when you dark
17:32
tall skinny you really will trust me
17:35
even if you are a bank you are uganda
17:37
and you have to first explain so then if
17:39
you're brown you have to explain
17:41
yourself that you know what yeah i'm
17:43
brown
17:43
i'm light skinned but i'm a loser but
17:46
you don't look like
17:47
them i feel like what do you like how do
17:49
they look
17:50
is different as we are privileged
17:52
because when you look at you just look
17:53
at somebody whenever
17:54
anytime you see class in somebody
17:56
automatically they'll work
17:57
you can never list that okay time time
18:00
time so
18:01
another thing like do you guys this is
18:04
like a fact they have
18:05
self praise do you guys have self yes
18:08
how do you call it yes
18:10
so first we say
18:14
like yourself praising yourself so
18:17
basically this happens
18:18
when you meet someone whom you're taking
18:21
long to meet
18:22
or you are in a family gathering or you
18:25
um having like an introduction
18:28
ceremony so that support can be crazy
18:31
new
18:32
like for me they have to say passion
18:34
yeah uh
18:35
nearly because first we have smith so we
18:37
are defined by uh
18:39
knives blah blah blah so you have to
18:41
have the things and then they back for
18:43
you
18:43
everything yes of miami
18:46
from pacquiao yeah yeah
18:49
so for you you also have your tribe so
18:53
they pack for you another thing like do
18:55
people live in homesteads
18:58
like you mean bombs yeah we live in um
19:00
state yeah
19:02
we live in amsterdam like it's the home
19:05
the father
19:06
your grandfather father uncle
19:23
they leave their fathers homestead and
19:24
they go understand to them so for
19:26
us i think for you guys it's more
19:28
communion
19:29
yeah so first you have your
19:32
grandfather's house
19:34
your father your other small fathers
19:36
that brother to your father or the big
19:38
father brother to your father
19:40
and then they also have their wives they
19:42
always also have children
19:44
like you stay in a simple so even food
19:46
if this family cooks
19:47
dinner lunch like they eat together
19:49
that's how
19:52
i think that is the best way because
19:54
it's uh it's a sign of love
19:55
and then it's a side of you and you need
19:58
to yeah
19:59
yeah so we have finally come
20:03
to the end of our video if you have
20:05
missed something i've not talked about
20:06
something
20:07
please comment below and now before we
20:09
finish the
20:10
what is your best team dude at the louis
20:13
identified with the particular
20:14
team here yeah in the evening
20:17
specifically about the lewis do you have
20:19
your team like uh
20:21
yeah we have teams like first impact we
20:24
have our
20:24
youngsters
20:28
because like in kenya we have guar maya
20:30
that is for lewis then but then most
20:31
people in because me my lower we are in
20:34
west nile part of uganda
20:35
so basically we support undo paraka
20:37
because it's from the west nile
20:39
okay but there are a lot of teams there
20:41
are teams in uh gulu
20:42
lira that play football but then because
20:45
of the baraka is in the ivana premier
20:47
league
20:48
so that's what we support yeah so even
20:50
us in the premier league we support uh
20:52
we support
20:52
goldmiah that is our national team it's
20:55
a team that i need for you they do
20:57
but because uh louie is a lifestyle and
21:00
everybody wants lifestyle all the other
21:02
people
21:02
i'm sure we have supporters even from
21:05
central you have suspenders from uh
21:07
the coastal regions and uh very soon
21:10
maya is going to be a national team oh
21:13
okay so basically we are not chose to
21:16
build those but you guys got lucky
21:18
