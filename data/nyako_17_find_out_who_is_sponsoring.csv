0:35
probably you already know what i'm going
0:37
to talk about because of the title
0:39
yes we are talking about the greatest
0:41
african youtuber that is wade maya if
0:44
you don't know
0:45
him so who is wada maya like if you
0:48
don't know what the mail then i can
0:49
probably
0:50
take you so whatever is a
0:53
african man is from ghana though he was
0:57
born
0:57
from nigeria he was born in nigeria then
0:59
they moved to ghana i think his parents
1:01
okay his parents were staying in
1:03
nigeria by the time he was born so so he
1:06
calls himself the one and only annoying
1:09
village boy from
1:10
ghana who is on a journey to change the
1:13
african narratives like
1:15
sirius he has done that i can give him
1:17
credit about that what
1:18
may has been a pillar in changing the
1:21
african narrative he has inspired people
1:23
like the africans in the diaspora to
1:25
come back
1:26
and then invest in africa which has been
1:29
really good
1:30
so like if you're not following him what
1:32
are you doing
1:33
what are you doing anyway but have you
1:36
followed me
1:37
follow me from what else has what the
1:39
maya done what the mayor has
1:41
changed the african narrative by
1:42
celebrating
1:44
the african excellence is this person
1:47
who has brought like you know
1:50
he has brought up the um industries
1:54
in ghana showing them over like
1:58
over and again from his youtube channel
2:00
hope you guys will follow him i've
2:02
seen that and witnessed that people have
2:04
been fearing to go to somalia
2:07
and south sudan but then throughout the
2:10
mayor's channel
2:11
i think most africans now are willing to
2:14
invest
2:15
in southern sudan and somalia because
2:19
he just showed to people that there's
2:21
more to whatever
2:23
the western culture or western media is
2:26
showing us so we can really you can
2:29
really
2:30
change that by reaching wherever we have
2:33
to reach by ourselves don't just go and
2:35
watch everything on tv how it's
2:37
portrayed because it's not true you have
2:39
to go there
2:40
and get to find out by yourself which
2:43
one the maya has done has
2:44
opened the eyes of the africans telling
2:47
them there is
2:48
more to africa there is good things in
2:50
africa
2:52
more than what is portrayed by the media
2:55
or the western media
2:56
so basically i upload that for the maya
2:59
like i really appreciate whatever things
3:01
is doing
3:02
is a good guy he is a true pan-african
3:05
guy though people talk about him the
3:08
negative way i'm not here to talk about
3:11
negativity i'm here to talk about
3:14
positive things and even praise whoever
3:18
deserves the praise so please subscribe
3:20
to my channel
3:22
hit the like button and press the
3:23
notification bell
3:25
let's go and see what what the maya has
3:27

3:31
ten thousand us dollar ten thousand us
3:35

3:48
managed to raise that money
3:50
and even him he got he's sponsoring
3:54
10 kids by himself
3:57
and is willing to sponsor more 100 kids
4:01

4:10
mind
4:10
like seriously what do we need what do
4:14

4:17
the maya in africa will be the great
4:19

4:28
going to african countries
4:30
