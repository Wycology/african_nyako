[Laughter]
1:10
okay
1:19
so guys at the end of the video you can
1:22
see we are all good twice just like few
1:25
seconds of crying because they are
1:27
scared of the car but don't come for me
1:29
actually i don't want anyone to tell me
1:32
that i made the kids cry or what because
1:35
it was just
1:36
seconds and funny like really funny so i
1:40
think i'm going to keep on bringing them
1:42
on the road so they can get used
1:46
with the
1:47
cars because literally they can't even
1:49
go in a car and when a car comes at home
1:53
they will run and hide
1:56
like hide they'll be uncomfortable until
1:59
the car leaves
2:17
so they get scared when they see a car
2:19
they won't see it from my distance but
2:21
when you temper taking them near the top
2:23
as hell
2:33
so you guys don't get to see this video
2:35
because every time the cars come they
2:36
run up to here but when they're actually
2:38

2:40
