1:10
i don't know i think this is catfish
1:14
this one
1:21
so i'm going to wash them
1:24
and we can cook
1:38
and this is what nail pot nail polish i
1:41
don't know
1:44
so
1:47
let me clean this
2:07
so this is okay intestines you have to
2:09
make sure you remove that
2:21
so they removed them already for me
2:24
it's easy but these ones i have to
2:26
remove them but i have to be careful so
2:28
that i don't prick myself
2:36
i think it's better like this
3:00
so you put that and then another one
3:07
[Applause]
3:28
[Applause]
3:30
oh
3:33
[Applause]
3:39
this is what you are going to cook
3:42
two different species of fish
3:45
[Applause]
3:50
so
3:51
before i do that i'm going to cut the
3:53
spices
3:56
this is our cooking oil that we're going
3:58
to use
4:12
tiny onions
4:15
so let me cut them and then i'll show
4:17
you guys
4:18
i really forgot here
4:20
let me cut them and then i'll show you
4:22
guys some when i'm doing what when i'm
4:25
frying the
4:41
hey guys
4:42
i already chopped like tomatoes
4:45
and onions
4:47
now
4:48
yeah there is so much than onions and
4:50
this is our cooking oil this is for 1000
4:52
shillings
4:54
and i'm using it
4:58
so you put it in the pan
5:06
and then
5:09
after
5:12
you add the onions
5:16
and then
5:19
okay the oil is still
5:21
cooking so when the oil fruit doesn't
5:24
take so long just one minute
5:27
and you add the onions and then
5:38
so this is um
5:40
stick for making that like
5:44
the sauce
5:45
then it's also called the mingling steak
5:52
so meanwhile when them
5:56
tomatoes no onions are getting golden
5:59
brown
6:00
you prepare your tomatoes ready
6:05
it's already one and we haven't eaten
6:07
food
6:08
my energy is low please forgive me
6:11
foreign
6:21
by the way this might look a lot but
6:23
it's just enough for lunch one meal only
6:27
you have a big family
6:30
so and then here because my onions are
6:33
already turned golden brown i'm going to
6:35
add in this
6:47
and fancy
6:49
this is where mr
6:52
this salt comes in
6:57
adding salt
7:09
told me
7:28
that's ready
7:43
so this is
7:44
cara powder this is probably very
7:46
important that's the one to use
8:02
so here
8:03
we use reiko most people in uganda use
8:05
draco
8:09
and
8:10
then that's when you add in water
8:20
i think this is enough for the soup
8:36
the salt
8:42
and then you're putting
8:44
your fish
8:46
you have to be careful because this fish
8:49
can
8:56
they look like
8:57
like crumbs
8:59
this one is still breeding
9:20
i think the first one is a little bit
9:22
smaller
9:37
um
