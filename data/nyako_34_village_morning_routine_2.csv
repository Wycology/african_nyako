welcome back to my youtube channel
0:11
[Music]
0:12
so today we are going to do a morning
0:14
routine
0:15
video so i've just woken up it's
0:18
seven saturn um
0:32
[Music]
0:45
so when you wake up in the morning the
0:47
first thing you do
0:48
is to take out the plates and cups that
0:52
you used
0:52
the previous night so this is what we
0:54
are doing
0:56
we are taking
1:10
me
1:12
i'm going
1:19
hey what's up
1:38
okay
1:46
so if you're going to wash them later
1:48
you leave them on
1:49
that stand but if you're going to wash
1:51
them immediately you put them down
1:53
that's why i was putting them down
2:05
so our kitchen is still and then
2:07
renovation that's why it's looking
2:09
messy but when the renovation is done it
2:12
will be all
2:13
nice and organized so bear with us at
2:16
this time
2:17
this is our hanging spot
2:21
it's called katan
2:25
then then this
2:29
is the place so you get one for putting
2:32
water
2:33
two of them
2:52
so when you put your things here you
2:55
first go and clean the kitchen
2:56
so we are going right away first clean
2:58
that kitchen
3:00
then we come and wash the plates and
3:02
then we make fire
3:03
poise
3:07
so after removing the pets and then you
3:10
go
3:10
and wash and sweep
3:30
um
3:35
so our compound is usually that in the
3:38
morning because the previous night we
3:40
cook from outside
3:41
and roasting um maize and whatever thing
3:45
we rush so
3:46
the compound in the morning is already
3:48
started so you have to
3:50
clean it by sweeping it that's why
3:53
we are sweeping the compound
4:24
so this is for washing this is
4:55
in persons
5:14
[Applause]
5:35
you have to use sand to clean
5:41
[Laughter]
5:51

6:18
this is clean done
6:46

6:53
[Applause]
7:00

7:04
so this is where you hung the plates
7:06
cups and uh
7:10
now it's called in english trailer a
7:12
tray
7:15
so yeah you put a dress
7:18
actually it's a tree okay
7:21
my sister said this is a tree and this
7:25
is these are cups and then place that's
7:26
where i put them up
7:28
and you put your suspense down there
7:32

7:35
this
7:36
then we can go to our second active that
7:37
is lighting the
7:39

8:02
usually we have cassava rice and um
8:06
maize for our breakfast but then this is
8:08
what we are having today
8:10
we're having this cassava for our
8:12
breakfast i don't know
8:14
how many i should cook because my aunt
8:18

8:46
and this is what we are having for our
8:52
breakfast
9:06
foreign
9:14
[Music]
9:21

9:23
that sour cassava or bitter cassava we
9:25

9:43
this is nice this is how you peel it
10:02
um
10:04

10:15

10:17
thing by doing like this i don't know
10:19
things in english so
10:21

10:24
tell you people
10:25
but this is what you do that's that
10:26
cassava it's sweets
10:31
anything okay when you do this you
10:34

11:45
ash because there is fire
11:54
take a name so you get this
11:57
