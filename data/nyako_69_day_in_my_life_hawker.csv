1:19
to be selling chicken on the road
1:22
as you can see
1:24
that place that's where like the
1:26
buses come from so this guy's basically
1:30
so there's something from there so we'll
1:32
be seeing every time the first time we
1:34
have to go there and sell them so tune
1:36
into the video till the end
1:40
so you have to wake up very early in the
1:42
morning at around 5 00 a.m and go to
1:44
where then
1:47
we get chicken against water but this
1:50
guy specifically he gets his chicken in
1:52
the evening after work and then in the
1:55
morning just look at him and come right
1:57
away
1:59
and he starts
2:00
making up like lightening
2:04
so he lights up the cigarette and then
2:06
starts roasting the chicken as you can
2:08
see it's all roasted all well ready to
2:11
go
2:12
so when you finish roasting hold them
2:14
into your hands and get ready anytime
2:16
now the bus is coming and will be
2:18
starting to sell
2:20
make sure you sprinkle some little salt
2:23
on it not so much because some people
2:25
don't like a lot of salt
2:27
make sure the salt is moderate and the
2:30
chicken is not burned so it really needs
2:33
a lot of supervision
2:35
and a lot of determination to do such
2:37
kind of work though i tried my best it
2:41
was very hot as you can see like it's
2:43
very very
2:44
so you guys the chicken is ready now i'm
2:46
holding it right in my hands you can see
2:50
holding it right in my hand it's got it
2:52
goes only for five thousand killings
2:55
let's go and start selling now we don't
2:58

hey
5:21
sample is here
5:27
so guys this job is not really that easy
5:30
actually i don't think there is any easy
5:32
job but
5:34
you have to keep on running like
5:36
literally every 30 minutes there's a bus
5:39
coming and you have to run catch up the
5:42
bus go to the customers ask them if
5:44
they're buying tell them the price and
5:46
if they don't buy it's still okay you
5:49
have to get the same energy that you
5:50
started with to go to another bus so
5:52
basically that's what you are doing but
5:54
there are a lot of public stats around
5:57
people selling water people selling meat
6:00
people selling ground nuts
6:03
people selling bananas for selling
6:05
tangerines selling oranges like a lot of
6:08
things there but regardless we go amaze
6:12
everything
6:14
you have to be strategically located you
6:16
have to run
6:18
run run run go and then sell
6:21
yeah that's eight but let's continue
6:23
let's see how the day is still going
6:25
actually i still have some energy
6:28
i'm trying to run
6:30
so
6:30
hopefully
6:32
we sell all the chicken that we have for
6:35
today
6:50
so i managed to talk to one guy he's
6:52
like on an average day he earns between
6:56
thirty thousand ugandan shillings to
6:59
eight a thousand ugandan shillings
7:01
depending
7:03
on how good that day has been so and
7:06
that's how anz is living that's how he
7:08
lives that's how he feeds his family
7:10
that's the mother and the siblings
7:12
because he comes from a
7:14
family that only has a mother so he has
7:17
to take care of his family
