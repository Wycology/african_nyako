very much let's continue
1:22
so what you need
1:24
you need flour this is cassava flour
1:27
we don't measure i told you we don't
1:29
measure it just puts
1:37
it
1:51
we need bananas these are
2:04
okay
2:34
[Music]
3:02
so you mix this like this
3:19
um
3:22
[Applause]
3:32
so you make sure you mix it properly and
3:35
you get a dough out of it
3:39
you have to make sure that you squeeze
3:41
them
3:42
literally so squeezing
3:44
anyway
3:53
and then you put the pine on the fire
3:56
when the pan is dry that's when you add
3:58
cooking oil
4:04
so this is the dark
4:07
mixture of flour and sweets
4:10
bananas
4:12
and
4:16
when the pan is dry that's when you add
4:18
your cooking oil
4:20
and
4:21
then
4:27
[Music]
5:05
um
5:07
[Music]
5:19
[Music]
5:21
foreign
5:25
[Music]
5:32
as you do this
5:38
do you have to make it in a circular
5:39
form
5:41
then make it like this
5:54
so after then you put them in the oil
5:56
and then you wait a little bit before
5:59
turning them if they start turning
6:00
golden brown
6:02
then you turn them as you can see in the
6:05
pan
6:17
so those ones are ready then i remove
6:20
them from the oil
6:22
make sure you were careful like very
6:24
careful otherwise or you can burn
6:33
yes so those them are ready and then you
6:35
put in others
6:37
like you continue that circle like that
6:39
put in they are golden ready you remove
6:42
them yes i call them
6:44
golden brown you remove them like that
6:48
as you can see but you have to be
6:50
careful
6:57
[Music]
7:09
you have to make sure i regulate the uh
7:12
fire because when you put a lot of fire
7:14
that things band like this one's almost
7:16
banned
7:57
so i had to give the twins first because
7:59
they were there waiting they couldn't
8:01
wait like to eat
8:02
so i had to give them but the pancakes
8:04
were really very hot
8:08
yes i gave them
8:10
and then went to my
8:13
but i think this one wanted more so he
8:15
was like oh that's so little they look
8:17
that he gave me i was like no you're not
8:19
going to give me a half a pancake he
8:21
