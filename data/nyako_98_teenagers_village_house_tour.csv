0:31
a teenager's house like in my village
0:34
here once a kid is
0:37
14 and above
0:39
they always actually from 15 okay let me
0:42
say 15 because other homes is from 13
0:44
and other homes is from 15. so 15 years
0:48
you get your own house here
0:50
so like they share they got like two
0:53
boys that are 15 and they build their
0:54
own house
0:56
of course their parents helped them up
0:57
to set up the house so this one
1:00
is for my brothers they sleep here let's
1:03
go inside and see what is in their house
1:10
you're welcome guys
1:15
so this is their house
1:17
this is their settings place
1:19
this is where they sit
1:22
here this small one and they have a
1:25
carton
1:26
to bisect
1:28
the sitting room and their
1:30
bedroom like the bedding space
1:33
yeah so basically there's nothing in a
1:35
city room apart from their
1:37
benson
1:39
these ones they use them to shower
1:41
so they keep them here i think they have
1:43
winter
1:45
they did not sweep their room
1:48
but their broom is also here
1:50
[Music]
1:51
their broom is here
1:54
and then
1:57
sanders
1:58
i think this one is spoiled but it's
2:00
really clean i think he washed it and
2:02
he's going to repair it to gun they made
2:04
it
2:05
that's why it's here and it's clean
2:08
and then
2:09
every guy like a teenager here
2:12
they make sure they work hard like work
2:14
help other people in their farm work
2:17
anything and then they save up or help
2:19
people in their building and they save
2:22
up money and they buy secondhand
2:24
bicycles so they also have a buy stop
2:27
so this is their bicycle
2:30
this is their base
2:32
so from there
2:34
this is the cutting
2:36
and behind the curtain
2:38
let me put it back this way i found it
2:40
because i didn't ask for permission
2:43
so behind the curtain
2:45
it's the bed okay well these guys never
2:47
laid down a bit so one of them sleeps
2:50
here
2:50
is about 15 years or 16
2:53
he sleeps here and they don't lay his
2:56
bed and this is a net like everywhere
2:59
like every household has a net because
3:02
there are a lot of mosquitoes you can't
3:03
sleep
3:05
uh without a musket on it because you
3:07
get malaria and those are also costs
3:09
and then this is like a white drop
3:12
this is this blanket
3:14
bed sheets
3:16
other bed sheets under clothes so he
3:19
hangs his clothes there and then there's
3:20
an extra meter yesterday i was looking
3:23
for an explanation
3:24
so this is the extranet probably we'll
3:26
take it
3:27
after the video so yeah this is a space
3:30
for one person and that's like his white
3:32
drop
3:33
the place for hanging their clothes so
3:35
there's bed sheets and then he's closed
3:37
as you see his trousers are here
3:40
t-shirts
3:42
another net and then school uniform so
3:44
they go to school they're in high school
3:47
so his uniform is there and then let me
3:50
put back this and then i show you the
3:53
second person's space
3:55
so the second person sleeps here
3:58
and he never laid this bed also
4:02
so here is clothes also
4:05
clothes t-shirts shirts and
4:08
beddings jeans
4:11
and a biscuit neck also
4:14
and then
4:16
school bag so this one
4:19
i think is the rich guy here in this
4:21
house because he has a school bag so
4:23
their suitcases are here
4:25
oh i've showed you his best for putting
4:27
clothes also
4:29
so it's basically
4:31
a wooden
4:32
bar or a stick
4:34
so this is where they hang their clothes
4:36
but then we are improvising let me put
4:38
this cutting up so that i can show you
4:40
guys
4:45
so i'll put it up
4:47
so yeah i'd put this
4:48
but then they have like a more modern
4:50
one whereby
4:52
they go this bar and then put this so
4:56
they just hang them like this
4:59
so basically these ones they always hang
5:00
there there's cool uniforms
5:03
and then here i don't know why this
5:05
clothes is right here it's also hanging
5:07
line
5:08
the other ones
5:09
yeah yeah yeah this is like the place
5:11
where they put the dirty clothes where
5:14
like which they are going to wash the
5:15
following day
5:17
or the week
5:19
this is where they so these are the
5:20
better clothes
5:24
why did i do that
5:26
this guy's
5:29
so this is a comb but they used to
5:31
scratch their hair
5:33
this one
5:34
and they even have lotions are these
5:36
guys
5:37
but they lotion soft and smoky ah
5:41
these guys have made it in life
5:44
these guys have made it in life so this
5:46
is their suitcase metallic ones i don't
5:48
want to open because of their privacies
5:50
so one thing one is there showing that
5:52
there are two people
5:54
there are two people in this house and
5:56
then this is like where they put on
6:01
some things
6:04
old phones
6:06
sim cards all these guys
6:09
i don't know what this is
6:12
whatever it is i don't know lotion
6:17
and
6:19
nice people
6:21
a spoon this is so funny people here is
6:24
a spoon
6:25
and then
6:26
stockings
6:28
and then
6:30
something to put her belt on
6:33
and then another phone
6:37
and then
6:38
a pen
6:41
and then another so here i think they
6:43
just collect whatever they want to
6:45
collect here
6:46
and then detergent powder this is nomi
6:50
so every
6:51
detergent here is called oma i don't
6:54
know why they buy um so normally i
6:55
cannot even call it almost
6:58
anyway next layer
7:00
what else so there are shoes here in the
7:03
corner i don't want to show you guys i
7:04
don't know if you can see cause it's
7:05
dark there
7:07
it's very dark and these
7:11
okay these guys have like a power bank
7:14
imagine ah to charge their phone so they
7:17
use a solar
7:19
the solar is outside is charging it then
7:21
after they will charge their phones
7:24
yeah so this is the mask then they put a
7:26
mattress on it
7:28
and i think we should talk from
7:29
ourselves everything you've seen here
7:31
they provide for themselves apart from
7:33
the school fees and some little clothes
7:35
that they buy for you but most times
7:37
they work for themselves and these
7:39
people even have a ball but you guys
7:41
know because they use solar it's
7:45
we are dealing with the rich guys around
7:49
so this rich guys
7:51
have a polar a solar panel
7:56
so it's connected like the wire runs
7:58
from here to the new camber
8:00
the wire runs from here
8:02
to inside where you saw the power bank
8:04
so it charges the power bank then they
8:06
use the fabric to check their phone and
8:09
even the lights that's about that so so
8:12
they washed their clothes
8:14
they're about 15 and 16 years they're
8:17
still young
8:19
this one wants to fall
8:22
yeah so that's it's their stockings
8:34
yeah
8:34
so what was i telling you guys yeah
8:37
everything that you saw there they
8:39
probably provide by themselves by
8:41
working doing some small jobs around
8:43
helping people build their houses like
8:45
if a person comes to build someone's
8:46
house they'll always be there like
8:48
helping
8:50
uh bringing signs mixing their
8:52
concrete think then they pay them like
8:54
two dollars to three dollars yeah that's
8:57
how they acquire whatever they have
9:00

9:03
