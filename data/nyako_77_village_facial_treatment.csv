0:23
our fisher
0:24
you get it straight from the plant it's
0:27
fresh
0:28
and then you use the juice as you'll be
0:31
seeing from the video so that's the aloe
0:34
vera plant and this is what we have got
0:36
so far
0:37
so we will remove the thorns around it
0:41
then
0:42
we can do whatever i want to do with it
0:53
hi guys welcome back to my youtube
0:55
channel it's another day another video
0:58
so basically someone wanted to know how
1:01
to do facial
1:02
like yeah facial scrub facial treatment
1:06
here in the village so i'm basically
1:08
going to show you guys what we do
1:10
i don't really have like a very nice
1:13
skin because i'm not like but constantly
1:16
doing those treatments on my skin like
1:18
i'm so so lazy when it comes to my
1:20
facial skin so but i'm going to show you
1:23
what most people here do especially the
1:26
teenagers and um
1:28
people below 30 years and above 20. so
1:33
let's so when you when you're doing a
1:35
session here
1:38
you need aloe vera you saw me getting
1:41
this aloe vera from the plant at the
1:43
beginning of the video
1:46
so this one is fresh from the plant so
1:48
what you do is
1:52
this like this
1:56
and this side
1:58
these are the phones so
2:01
so they look pretty you have to remove
2:03
them and then another thing what you
2:05
need you need lime so this is
2:08
an orange
2:09
but some people can use um
2:13
lemon or
2:15
tangerine
2:20
so here this is our lemon i'll cut it
2:24
into two
2:30
so i'll use one part
2:32
which is this
2:34
and this one i'll eat it
2:39
it's so juicy
2:50
oh this is so nice you people yeah i'm
2:52
going to do that fashion
3:12
i'm not doing this video before i finish
3:14
this
3:22
yeah so when you use sap in your face
3:25
you have to take some you going
3:28
yeah
3:29
so we need that and the third thing that
3:30
we need is um
3:34
crystals
3:35
of sugar
3:37
so this is sugar we use it as crab
3:40
yeah
3:41
so let's start
3:43
so what you do you get a bowl this is a
3:46
small bowel
3:47
and put in your crystals of sugar
4:00
but some people use clay soil
4:03
yeah some people use clay soil but me i
4:05
like using sugar
4:08
skin
4:09
and then
4:11
get your lime
4:15
and then squeeze it
4:26
so after squeezing it
4:30
you remove the seeds
4:33
you see
4:39
and then
4:42
then you get your
4:44
aloe vera
4:52
and peel it
4:54
so that you can get the juice
5:13
so you see
5:19
this is the leverage it's coming out
5:36
so you guys can see this so you just
5:38
squeeze it like this
5:41
and that's what we need
5:46
after
5:49
you put aloe vera after putting the pera
5:54
stir it
5:56
like this
6:00
as you can see
6:01
and then
6:03
use this other part
6:06
so you use this other part to cleanse
6:09
your skin
6:10
like this
6:23
so when you do this
6:25
and you see it's clean this is what you
6:27
used to clean your skin
6:31
then you get a
6:32
solution make sure you scoop
6:36
the dough now and this ones
6:39
and then
6:40
pack them here
7:05
so this is what we do
7:07
we scrub the face
7:14
you get your mixture
7:22
my
7:23
chest is all covered so brian you can
7:26
cross it here
8:06
so you get this still
8:09
and put
8:24
shhh so you leave it to stay on your
8:27
face i can't see because there is lemon
8:30
i mean the unorange and the reverse i
8:32
don't want them to enter my eyes but
8:34
always avoid these other parts like this
8:36
part so that you can't see
8:38
but then meeting someone i'll tell you
8:40
what to do so basically this is what we
8:42
do
8:44
and when your skin
8:45
feels good after
8:48
scrubbing it you get warm water but then
8:50
we don't always use more water use cold
8:53
water so i'm going to use that cold
8:55
water here
8:56
it's here
8:58
so this is the jericho that has cold
9:00
water
9:02
this is what we do
9:05
feels nice trust me
9:20
[Music]
9:33
so you guys don't mind so
9:36
this is what you do
9:39
i think you can see a difference now my
9:40
skin feels good so i have some rashes
9:44
like the people
9:46
but i don't really mind about them
9:48
so basically that's what we do here
9:51
we use aloe vera
9:54
lemon or
9:56
an orange or tangerine so you can either
10:00
use
10:01
sugar
10:02
or
10:03
clay
10:04
to scrub your face so that's what we do
10:07
i hope you've learned something you've
10:09
learned how people in that village yes
10:10
in my village do their facial treatment
10:14
yeah that's what we do so
