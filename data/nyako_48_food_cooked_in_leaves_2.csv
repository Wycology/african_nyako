[Music]
0:19
so
0:21
i'm going to be adding these tomatoes
0:23
but i haven't cut them so i'm going to
0:24
cut the tomatoes and then i add them
0:27
then after i'll show you guys when i'm
0:29
adding the
0:31
groundnuts
0:52
so our food is boiling
0:54
no rush it's going to take
0:57
to 1 hour i think it will be ready
1:00
yeah they know
1:03
when you got it i don't know in english
1:07
it's smashing or squeezing any of that
1:10
anyway
1:11
so yeah
1:13
i think now we should put on this
1:16
our sauce
1:18
and let me see how we are progressing
1:31
good to go now i can add this
1:36
beginners
1:43
so we are making dinner paste
1:48
beef
2:00
the salty did you guys know the rules of
2:03
the salt we don't measure
2:05
we put
2:07
until
2:09
until what
2:10
our ancestors tells us to stop
2:14
so i think
2:16
my answer starts to tell me when to stop
2:18
because
2:20
my instincts are still telling me to add
2:22
more
2:24
of the salt
2:31
guys this looks yummy
2:49
if it's a lot
2:51
but
2:52
our ancestors can never go wrong so it
2:55
cannot be a lot
2:57
you guys i'm like this because of the
2:59
smoke
3:00
there's a lot of the smoke coming from
3:02
the firewood cooking place
3:06
so never mind
3:07
[Music]
3:11
now let's wait for that time
3:14
of squeezing them at okay and then
3:18
so for our vegetables these ones
3:21
we are going to use this to cook them or
3:24
steam them so you get a banana leaf and
3:26
then you put it on fire
3:29
just a little bit
3:31
to make it soft and able
3:34
to hold your vegetables
3:39
as you can see
4:11
okay
4:13
so we are going to put them here
4:19
so you cut your vegetables greens like
4:22
this
4:24
and after when you cut them put them
4:27
onto here
4:30
and then
4:32
put some of this these are onion leaves
4:37
just a little bit
4:39
spice them up
4:43
so it will give them a nice aroma
4:47
and spiced up
4:49
and then add some
4:51
tomatoes
4:59
these are vegetable tomatoes these small
5:01
tomatoes for salads
5:03
so you put them here
5:09
i also know if i've put a lot
5:12
and then one more thing to add here
5:16
onions
5:18
if you have curry powder you can put
5:20
so after putting all the things in the
5:22
leaves then you put some salt and then
5:27
wrap them in the banana leaf and then
5:30
put on to the fire after tying them with
5:34
the banana fiber
5:36
as you can see in the video
5:39
basically that's what i was doing then
5:41
open your boiling food and add that on
5:45
top
5:47
check if our food is ready
5:50
and then
5:51
we
5:52
do whatever it's necessary
5:59
so this is our brains
6:02
that we had just put
6:04
let me get something to get them
6:07
off
6:08
i don't want to burn myself that's why
6:11
i'm using this
6:17
actually
6:26
really very hot
6:36
let me just cut it
6:41
so this is how the
6:43
everything is ready
6:45
um
7:00
foreign
7:10
[Music]
7:16
this water is to help me
7:19
not get burnt
7:26
this is our potatoes
7:35
they are very ready
7:37
skinned
8:04
you remove it from here and put it here
8:06
and then you can squeeze it
8:09
like this
8:10
put some water because it's very hot
8:13
and then smash them
8:25
if your hands are very hot
8:27
you can use this
8:29
also
8:31
you guys can see they are smashed
8:35
not really well
8:37
but i'm
8:38
trying because they might okay we're
8:41

8:49

8:50

8:52
