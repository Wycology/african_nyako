2:20
woman if any they're just helping me
2:22
hold the camera but they talk into the
2:24
video
2:25
they keep on interrupting me and it
2:27
annoys me
2:29
today we are actually going to cook from
2:30
outside again because it's dark inside
2:32
and i cannot capture for you guys nice
2:35
video if i'm doing from this i don't
2:37
have ring lights i don't use any light
2:39
up to use this natural light and it's
2:41
almost seven
2:43
seven pm so
2:45
we have to hurry up
2:48
before it's done
2:50
so that's why i'm putting the firewood
2:52
and then i can show you guys
2:55
while it's lighting
3:08
so this is our
3:10
leafy okra
3:12
we need to prepare it
3:14
so this is what you do
3:17
you get one like this and you do this
3:34
guys you can see what you do
3:37
so that's what you do
3:42
you got a soft part on me
3:56
and then this one you throw it away
4:19
throw that
4:25
now
4:34
so after after this okay i'll continue
4:37
with that but let me first show you even
4:39
here so after you do that this is the
4:41
fish we are using
4:43
these ones
4:44
we call them lagogi so i don't know how
4:46
you guys call them if you have them
4:48
please can you comment below and tell me
4:52
can you
4:53
come in
4:58
and it's really nice when you combine it
5:00
with this that you're going to do so
5:03
this is how you prepare it your room
5:06
do this remove the edge the head
5:11
and then
5:13
cut
5:18
and you remove the bones so they don't
5:20
get stuck so you remove that bone like
5:22
this
5:25
and put that here
5:28
remove the head
5:30
through the head and then get a knife
5:33
bisect it
5:37
like this
5:39
and then remove the buns
5:43
okay
5:44
so this is the last one i'm showing you
5:46
guys then i can do others off
5:50
camera
5:57
so you remove that burning
6:05
so our fire is there
6:07
lighting
6:09
and let me do this off camera shop shop
6:12
then i can show you guys the next step
6:13
because we are timely but
6:15
yeah so guys i've already organized them
6:19
now i'm going to chop them cut cut cuts
6:27
you have a huge knife
6:29
a giant knife
6:32
don't worry
6:43
so this is how we cut
6:49
meanwhile i have to put soda by
6:51
carbonates
6:52
in there
6:54
my daddy
6:55
so i had already grinded it
6:59
already grinded it here
7:27
make the things
7:34
so you guys we have already chopped our
7:35
things and we have put the soda
7:37
bicarbonate there
7:39
so let's put it inside
7:44
so let's put this our leafy okra
7:48
in here
7:52
and it's going to occur
7:55
when it's trackering
7:58
it's going to boil
8:04
this
8:05
chicken
8:08
okay from outside is not easy because
8:10
you can be like attacked by a lot of
8:12
things
8:20
it's outside kitchen
8:23
it's an open kitchen
8:37
so this is our authentication
8:53
[Music]
9:06

[Music]
9:44
you have to make sure there is enough
9:58

thank you
10:30
so this is the stage at which you add in
10:32
your fish small fish
10:35
like that
10:36
then you style
10:38
stairs i don't know whatever it is
10:42
and then
10:44
this junction
10:47
that's when
10:48
you put in some salt
10:52
we all measure so to just put i think
10:55
this is enough
11:05
so this is enough salt
11:24
you guys so it has a very nice aroma you
11:26
can really feel it
11:32
so here i'm going to leave it to boil
11:34

11:46
hope you have enjoyed the video so you
11:49
leave it to boil for
11:51
eight to ten minutes with the soda
11:54
bicarbonate that we added it acts like a
