3:31
so guys i already made a video about
3:33

3:35
like does it hurt let me give you
3:37
another video yeah so this is basically
3:39
then right it's made of um
3:41
made out of
3:42
maize like you boil maize and
3:45
corns like them yamaza the corns and
3:48
then beans so brown beans
3:52
then you mix them together so you first
3:54
cook the maize
3:56
you put the beans on top
3:59
for
4:00
four hours they will be ready and then
4:02
you make those onions that you can see
4:06
put onions in the cooking oil make them
4:09
golden brown
4:11
so people like it with oil but i don't
4:13
like it
4:14
but then we had to buy because today i
4:16
told you that we have like visitors
4:19
at home so we had to buy like a lot of
4:21
them those ones are about
4:23
eight dollars
4:26
so as i said it's eight thousand that is
4:28
like two dollars and something we're not
4:30
enough yeah
4:31
in a row so that's what we are going to
4:33
have for our breakfast today with dry
4:35
tea dried like the white thing yeah
4:38
water and um
4:54
you're going to
4:55
so this is our place today to rain now i
4:58
can show you the ground is all done
5:00
because it's rain but then our soil is
5:02
sandy that's why we don't have mud this
5:05
is a small place that they sell grocery
5:08
like you can buy the
5:10
beans and whatever
5:12
whatsoever you want to buy and this is a
5:15
chicken
5:16
and that is the community
5:19
so you guys hope you enjoyed this video
5:22
don't forget to subscribe to my channel
5:24
please and thank you very much for 2k
5:26
subscribers
5:28
i do really appreciate the support
5:30
thank you very much so as i've promised
5:32
you guys
5:33
i'm going to be giving you content as
5:36
much as i can
5:38
yeah let's see that
5:42
so you guys these are ground nuts we got
5:44
them from the garden
5:46
now we are plaquing them from this
5:51
so this is how it is when it's from the
5:53
garden fresh and then you pluck them
5:56
like
5:57
this
5:58
like this
6:04
so after plucking we separate them these
6:07
ones are already flat and these ones
6:09
have been so we still have a lot of work
6:10
to do so
6:12
they all love today we are going to be
6:14
doing this
6:15
and then when you pluck them
6:17
in here
6:18
so we have so far flat one pencil this
6:21
is advancing
6:23
so this is one benson we have clapped it
6:26
i'm looking there because i'm recording
6:28
using two points
6:30
so
6:31
this is already plugged man i can show
6:33
you the grains how they look like
6:45
but these ones you can't even eat them
6:49
before
6:51
cooking so if you want to boil them and
6:53
have them with your breakfast or you can
6:56
wait for them to first dry and you make
6:58
a groundnut paste
7:00
from them so it's supporting you but
7:03
then people here eat a lot of groundnut
7:05
paste so these are going to first sundry
7:08
them after sundrying them we can grind
7:10
them and we make sauce maybe i will show
7:12
you guys how we make sauce from this
7:14
when they dry
7:18
so anyway this is not the main
7:20
reason why i made this video this video
7:22
was too thank you guys for taking me to
7:24
