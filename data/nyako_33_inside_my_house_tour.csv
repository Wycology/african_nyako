0:52
and this is made of mud and
0:55
black soil yeah
0:59
so let's go in and see what is inside
1:02
the village
1:03
house come with me
1:15
so when you enter this house this is the
1:17
first thing you'll see
1:18
it's a cutting
1:22
yeah this is our cutter and then this is
1:24
the dough
1:26
it's made of um old iron sheets
1:30
yeah and this is our padlock to keep the
1:33
house
1:35
safe and here behind that door
1:39
it's our refrigerator a pot
1:43
and in every household here in the
1:46
village you'll find when the airports
1:47
are behind that door i don't know why
1:50
but that's what we do
1:51
and then these spots usually have a
1:54
couple needs
1:56
so this cup is for
1:59
scooping water from the pot and then you
2:02
drink
2:04
then remember me i'm not thirsty right
2:06
now and then you
2:08
drink and then this
2:11
we call it but
2:15
it's uh all right a bucket i don't know
2:18
for a vested water so when you waste
2:20
water you keep it here
2:22
because the river is very far like very
2:25
fast
2:26
and this is a jerry fan for fishing
2:28
water so this brings us to
2:31
our sleeping area so this is where the
2:33
children sleep
2:35
so if you have four children five they
2:38
all sleep here
2:39
and cover themselves with this one card
2:43
one part is for sleeping
2:44
and the other part is for covering
2:46
yourself
2:47
yeah and that will bring us to the
2:49
bedroom for the elders the big people
2:52

2:53

3:00
mattress and now i drop
3:02
where to keep your clothes and the bed
3:04
sheets and i'm a fit on it
3:07
it's a must cause we have mosquitoes all
3:09
over uganda so
3:10
you need atmospheres on it and then your
3:12
bedsides
3:14

3:17
and then let's go to our sitting room
3:20

3:34
like this house they are the middle
3:38

3:41
usually they put the
3:44

5:40
of cookie
5:42
stones and this is where we keep our
5:46
you know these are things that we used
5:47
to eat we don't have it's a big family
5:49
but you cannot find a lot of let's
5:52
because we only use one plate on this
5:55
to eat all of us like when we are ten
5:58
so basically have a few utensils to do i
6:01
have to wash
6:02
at the end of it and then you have to
6:04
have another
6:06
pot for water even in that kitchen
6:10
yeah so this is the pot in the kitchen
6:13
and you just get this is that
6:17
so yeah you get a cup and you still
6:19
drink water from there
6:21
there's a comment so this is like this
6:24
because of the smoke that comes from
6:29
the fireplace that's why it's this color
6:31
but there's no problem with it we can
6:33
still cook and eat
6:35
well and live for years yeah basically
6:38
that's
6:39
it about nothing something i'm not sure
6:42
this one is called
6:46
this one is for making
6:51
making what same same test yeah
6:55
this one you do like that then
6:59
you grind like this i'll do a video
7:02
about it also
7:05
what else yeah i think that is it for
7:08
our kitchen
7:10
let's move on
7:14
yeah and then we have this it's called
7:16
pine
7:18
this one and it's called
7:21
water but i don't know where the piston
7:24
is yeah this side we have
7:28
this and this so if you want to make um
7:32
cassava flour you have to put
7:36
this this is a cassava flour put inside
7:39
here
7:40
then you do like this
7:46
yeah after you put it on
7:49
i don't know if it's also called the
7:51
sieve
7:54
and then you save it and then you mingle
7:56
in a panel
7:59
now if i'm showing you now kitchen
8:04
thing so this is where we bring our
8:05
purchase from put water and put it there
8:08
then you make your portion and this is
8:11
the portion
8:13
the mingle this is the mingled portion
8:17
yeah those are the left over so we're
8:19
going to feed them to our animals
8:28
so our kitchen is also a house for the
8:32
chicken
8:33
so when they come here i thought at
8:35
seven or six
8:37
they will enter and then you cover them
8:39
like this
8:41
like this so we put these things in casa
8:44
but
8:44
this ego enters or a postcard cannot
8:47
come and take the cheeks
8:48
so you protect them with this cloth
8:53
like that then in the morning you come
