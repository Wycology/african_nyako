today
1:13
i'm taking whatever we have been getting
1:16
from the garden outside actually it's
1:18
the morning routine
1:20
during our dry season what do we do
1:22
during the dry season we get them from
1:24
the garden and then
1:26
in the morning before you go to a vest
1:28
you first take them under the sunshine
1:30
to dry
1:31
so
1:32
and then my dad is going to build
1:36
a granary where we keep all these things
1:39
but for now
1:40
let me take you
1:42
through my morning routine
1:46
let's go
1:47
so this is um
1:48
millet but
1:50
but before i take a minute out we use
1:52
this thing
1:54
this one
1:56
to
1:58
dry them
2:30
foreign
2:53
is
3:10
foreign
3:28
[Applause]
3:30
tell me
3:51
okay
4:05
[Music]
4:12
[Music]
4:26
know
4:27
[Applause]
4:37
that's millet
4:39
this is
5:28
[Applause]
5:36
um
5:39
[Music]
6:10
okay
6:25
[Music]
6:31
then we shall go for our breakfast
6:45
[Applause]
6:58
[Music]
7:08
[Music]
7:15
[Music]
7:28
so
7:30
yeah
7:52
[Applause]
8:09
so these are good nets we put them we
8:12
sand dry them from
8:14
here like
8:15
away from the compound because when you
8:18
put them at the compound people will be
8:20
eating them
8:21
and then we lose a lot of them
8:32
oh
8:36
i'm tired of it
8:44
so these are ground nuts
8:46
we have to put them here in the bush
8:50
keep them away from people to eat them
8:53
because if you leave them the other
8:54
compound
8:56
they'll leave them on
9:02
[Music]
9:08
not even may i want to eat some
9:14
but you guys i showed you these peanuts
9:16
when we are planting them i think
9:21
i showed you
9:23
those ones are so fresh
9:26
you can't even boil them so we always
9:28
boil them look at them wash them well
9:31
and boil them for our breakfast
9:34
that's what we ate yesterday and today
9:36
we are having sweet potatoes that i
9:38
showed you
9:39
but i don't think i'll have them because
9:42
they put salt in sweet potatoes so
9:44
doesn't taste nice for me
9:47
this is a problem every time i come to
9:49
put this here to sun dry it i eat
9:58
guys
9:59
this is what we do during the dry season
10:03
and then
10:04
after two weeks we will be done
10:07
with them drying everything
10:09
and we will be in christmas mood
10:12
people will be selling their crops with
10:15
money
10:16
facilitate them during christmas
10:21
buy meat chicken okay people have
10:23
chickens that come they rare chicken
10:25
and if you don't have any you have to
10:27

10:28
