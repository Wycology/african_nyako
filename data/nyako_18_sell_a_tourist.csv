1:58
video just
1:59
so sarah is i can engulf
2:02
very young talented kind
2:06
beautiful like she's just everything
2:10
this girl is very kind i've been
2:13
following her vlogs for
2:16
a long time now even before she met the
2:19
moon bro
2:20
but then she became more active when she
2:22
met
2:23
the mango so basically the mango thank
2:25
you very much for
2:27
giving a hand try i know you helped her
2:30
he too and care then she has been also
2:32
putting a lot of work
2:34
but what blew my head is like blew my
2:37
mind away
2:38
this girl has been helping her community
2:42
like who wants like who doesn't want to
2:45
do that
2:46
in this uranus so basically you might be
2:49
knowing this human is under a total
2:51
i try to look down like you want this
2:53
underactor to look down like you can not
2:56
go anywhere
2:57
so basically a lot of families a lot of
3:00
families suffering in the villages even
3:03
in the urban areas
3:05
actually it's worse in the urban areas
3:07
of uganda but then if
3:09
i look into youtube and i find someone
3:12
young doing that helping poor people
3:16
people that cannot feed themselves
3:19
called dairy people like
3:20
it's really blown my mind where they
3:22
thank god for their life and i always
3:24
pray for them
3:25
to have like a better life and even keep
3:28
on
3:28
impacting on people's life so basically
3:31
why did they
3:32
choose to talk about seven sarah
3:35
a tourist is a very kind girl she's
3:38
humble though i've not met her like
3:42
physically but have sent her messages on
3:46
instagram she's really a good
3:50
person i've been following her vlogs
3:52
like i'll be following her video
3:54
so basically she says um she's based in
3:57
ginger
3:59
and this is what she has been doing
4:01
trust me
4:02
she has been giving back to her
4:03
community
4:05
she even built a house for her father
4:09
through um like through her
4:12
social media platform like by youtube
4:16
she got some people to send them money
4:18
but like seriously
4:20
if it was someone else they wouldn't
4:22
have used the money
4:24
as it was intended for but this girl has
4:27
been buying
4:28
almost everything to support those
4:30
families
4:32
you know like buying food for 20
4:33
families you buy for them
4:35
food give them lamps like the solar
4:37
lamps because
4:38
if you've ever been in the village then
4:39
you know what it means by
4:42
sleeping in a house without my
4:44
electricity
4:46
so if someone donates for you alarm just
4:48
allow
4:49
trust me that's like i haven't sent
4:54
so i really appreciate our work what i
4:57
could
4:57
encourage all africans to really support
4:59
each other let's be there for each other
5:02
let's make africa a better place to live
5:04
in so
5:05
this god you people if i'm if i'm to
5:08
talk about whatever she has done
5:10
she has been helping the elderly people
5:13
in our community
5:14
giving back to our society during this
5:17
lockdown this is a
5:18
very very hard time like hard situation
5:21
in your guide
5:22
most families are sleeping without food
5:25
like i don't know people have been
5:27
committing suicide before corona kills
5:29
you someone has already died you
5:31
understand
5:31
so if you see someone impacting in their
5:34
society
5:35
like that you have to give them a lot of
5:37
like we have to
5:40
appreciate them we encourage them when
5:42
we appreciate
5:43
them they have like they are going to
5:46
work
5:47
harder like harder so i really
5:50
appreciate that girl
5:51
and i'm going to put her link below for
5:53
her channel so that you guys can also go
5:55
and subscribe to her channel and support
5:58
her and another thing after i look
6:00
down because right now we cannot move
6:02
better i would like to help
6:05
do some activities with her because
6:06
she's really open
6:08
to anyone you can go
6:11
help whatever thing you have you can
6:14
help
6:15
so i was overwhelmed with whatever
6:18
things she has been doing to her
6:19
community like seriously i'm like this
6:21
girl is a deal breaker because many
6:24
people are on youtube they are
6:26
successful
6:27
but they're not doing anything we just
6:29
watch their vlogs going to resorts doing
6:31
what
6:32
but this girl this girl
6:36
this girl is another thing she's on
6:38
another level like helping
6:40
her community her community like
6:43
she's changed to a community she's like
6:46
the messiah
6:48
so everyone can change the community but
6:51
then change starts with you
6:53
like what have you done to change your
6:55
community have you
6:56
impacted your community in any way have
6:59
you helped anyone
7:01
like help comes from your heart like
7:03
your heart
7:05
so please i just ask
7:09
for anyone to help anyone it doesn't
7:12
matter where you are like doesn't matter
7:14
just help someone because someone might
7:16
be needing you
7:17
you might save a life by helping
7:21
only one person like this other person
7:23
also help someone so that's how we can
7:25
extend
7:25
love in this continent so i'm here to
7:29
appreciate people doing good i did a
7:31
video about twitter maya
7:32
you can also watch that he's a great
7:35
great partner free camera
7:37
so basically let's not
7:40
spread negativity
7:44
let's support whoever is doing good work
7:48
let's keep together africans
7:52
yeah i think that's all about this girl
7:55
but she's
7:56
a great person like as i told
7:59
everybody's channel
8:00
this channel is about positivity so
8:03
if you're negative you have a negative
8:06
mindset please
8:07
