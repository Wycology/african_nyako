0:19
thank you very much let's go into the
0:23
[Music]
0:28
video very dangerous
0:32
they actually kill more people buffaloes
0:33
have killed more people than lions have
0:35
killed people
0:36
so these guys clear extremely dangerous
0:40
and for them they can attack even
0:41
without warning hold out for you doing
0:43
them anything but they just come for you
0:45
like that
0:46
then they knock you out they hit you
0:49
with their hands
0:50
these birds here which look like ducks
0:51
are called the egyptian geese
0:54
so stay here with them hey but sometimes
0:56
they'll fly away go to the lake you find
0:58
them swimming in their lake
1:00
early morning and sometimes even in the
1:02
evening
1:05
we supposed to also see the white hogs
1:07
here
1:08
they are members of the pig family but i
1:10
think most of them were moved
1:12
okay yeah they're moved they think
1:14
temporarily first take them to the vet
1:16
they give them some vaccines and whatnot
1:27
so i killed him uh he was actually a
1:31
disease
1:32
but because of his extreme old age he
1:35
could not recover
1:50
this guy is a herbivores and they eat
1:52
mainly plant matter
1:54
okay uh while the turtles we have to
1:58
give them fish
1:59
okay so these are therapies
2:03
no this is the total tatters the
2:04
philippines are those ones there
2:06
yeah like turtles but just small and
2:09
water okay
2:11
understand why for them they can see now
2:14
this is a
2:15
little you can live close to 100 to 150
2:18
years
2:18
how old is that one i know these ones i
2:20
can't really tell you the edge
2:22
okay i think even this one is in a
2:24
hundred because it's almost the same
2:25
size or the other but they say
2:26
you can get the edges by counting them
2:30
estimating okay yeah that's an
2:33
estimation and i don't
2:34
more than be aware of okay but it's the
2:37
fourth largest status there are other
2:38
species of tauruses
2:40
that are gonna grow bigger than this one
2:42
and even live longer than some places
2:44
they can live up to 300 years
2:48
wow
2:51
so this one leaves 100 to 150
3:08
another one
3:30
oh
3:43
eating his
3:58
oh
4:00
these guys come soon
4:01
[Music]
4:08
but then under in uganda no we have them
4:10
in uganda
4:11
you find them around fresh water on some
4:13
parts of vietnam you'll find them
4:15
even on lake victoria's around some
4:18
areas you find them there
4:20
like neon gamba you can find these
4:21
things in the water
4:23
i don't like that they they can't stay
4:24
in the place which is polluted
4:29
but the water is not that fresh uh here
4:32
okay
4:32
why the water is like this is because
4:34
very soon i'm going to drain this water
4:36
and just grab the pond okay yeah
4:39
i'm going to drain and scrub the pore
4:40
then you fill it back with uh better
4:42
water yeah
4:43
but i was really find them in the wild
4:45
they usually stay what
4:48
fresh water
5:08
up
5:22
okay
5:26
you just cut in big big pieces you put
5:28
in the water they'll do the rest
5:30
also here we're going to drain this
5:32
place and we're going to scrub it
5:34
but you first put these guys out
5:43
for them to attack you they want to
5:45
ambush you
5:46
to get you by surprise when you're
5:48
scrapping here you walk one person's job
5:50
is just to stand and look at the
5:51
crocodiles
5:55
so they know that you're looking at them
5:56
they can't come for you but when they
5:58
know that you're absent-minded
6:00
that's when they attack and usually they
6:02
have the advantage there
6:03
okay because they hit you strong or they
6:06
hold you
6:07
and it's hard to escape their jaws
6:20
and they don't attack humans there is no
6:23
report of cheaters killing or attacking
6:25
people
6:26
they're actually very popular as exotic
6:32
pets
6:35
you saying the arabs usually have those
6:36
things as peter
8:10
um
8:24
squeeze you until you die then you'll
8:26
follow your word
8:30
ah these guys can follow something three
8:32
times bigger than them
8:35
okay yeah i don't know if it will follow
8:37
you but at least i'm sure it can kill
8:38
you
8:41
and it has a very painful bite it's made
8:44
by you very very painful so coming past
8:46
the side
8:49
so this next year we feed them every
8:51
after two weeks
8:52
oh they are saying they must be each
8:54
right
8:56
they don't need to eat everything they
8:57
can stay alive yeah for them
9:20
um
9:22
[Music]
9:44
okay but this one is the xenomorph snake
9:47
very very venomous this one doesn't spit
9:49
but
9:50
the bite from it is uh we can kill you
9:53
in like
9:54
70 minutes okay
9:57
if you're not rushed to the hospital
9:58
okay
10:01
so these people have like anti-venom for
10:04
anything happening no but we know where
10:06
we can take you for you to get there
10:09
if you get beaten here you know where we
10:12
can rush you
10:16
but it's always good to avoid this
10:18
vision
10:20
here we should be able to see this
10:24
one there in the corner
10:29
the snake with the longest fans of any
10:31
snake in the world
10:32
is the carbon driver and for it if it
10:34
bites you be sure that after medications
10:37
are going to cut off
10:38
one of your body parts if it bites your
10:40
leg you cut off your leg if it bites the
10:42
fingers one of your fingers is in your
10:45
body
10:46
yeah no the the venom actually digests
10:48
flesh
10:49
and there's nothing they can do about
10:51
that apart from amputations
11:11
this is
11:14
now that means that he is about to start
11:16
shaking his skin
11:17
oh okay that's the first sign when you
11:19
see those gray eyes
11:21
but also this one is very venomous and
11:24
for it is
11:24
very very aggressive this is a snake
11:27
when you find it
11:28
it will want to bite you and it wants to
11:29
bite you more than once
11:31
okay the snake is also known for eating
11:33
other snakes
11:35
okay yeah egyptian cobra he can swim
11:38
very well
11:39
and his venom is very concentrated
11:41
because this is next we stay in the
11:43
desert
11:43
the venom is more dangerous than it's
11:46
next to stay in forests
