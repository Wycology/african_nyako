good morning guys welcome back to my
0:02
youtube channel
0:04
so today we're doing my skincare routine
0:07
like what do i
0:08
do on my skin
0:11
so basically here i had to put apply
0:14
avocado i like using nature products on
0:17
my skin though i don't do it every day
0:18
so today i was doing it and i'm like why
0:20
don't i record this
0:22
so i had to record so i get avocado and
0:25
then i put lime in it like little bit of
0:28
lemon then i
0:29
put i apply it on my face
0:32
like smoothly then leave it to dry or
0:36
think in the face for some time like for
0:40
10 to 15 minutes after that when it's
0:43
absorbed by the skin like it renovates
0:47
and opens the pore because of the lime
0:49
that is in
0:50
yeah then i clean my face
0:59
so here after applying the avocado and
1:03
washing it
1:04
like i use a cotton to clean them
1:07
off because cotton is smooth and it
1:09
cannot damage my skin you know that skin
1:12
like the facial skin is so
1:14
so sensitive so you have to be careful
1:17
on whatever thing you put
1:19
so i used a cotton to rub them off
1:23
and then yeah you can see one cotton
1:26
it's really dirty
1:27
and then the other one is clean so the
1:28
other one is the one i use at last so it
1:31
indicates that my skin is now clean
1:34
then i can get my face wash and apply it
1:37
on my skin yeah so that's the fish
1:41
the face wash that i use apply it gently
1:45
on my skin and do upward movements
1:48
no one wants to get wrinkles so
1:50
basically have to mind about the
1:52
movements you do on your face
1:55
yeah so i used that just to cleanse my
1:59
face and wash it every morning
2:01
and then i used luke warm water not that
2:04
hot but just
2:05
warm on my face yeah so basically that's
2:09
what i was
2:10
doing
2:14
and another thing you have like you
2:16
don't have to forget your neck make sure
2:17
when you're doing your
2:18
facial routine um
2:22
include your neck because i don't want
2:24
you to have a neck that doesn't look
2:26
like your face like seriously so weird
2:29
it's so weird but that's me then i had
2:32

2:41
about you guys but me it works for me
2:44
yeah so then i have to wash it
2:46
off as you can see
2:53
so then after that i have to get my
2:56
thing that i used to scrub and then i
2:59
scrub
2:59
my face a little bit gently
3:03
like seriously you have to be gentle on
3:05
your skin
3:06
otherwise you'll get like
3:09
bruises because the skin is so so
3:13
complex i don't know like you have to
3:15
handle it with
3:16
care trying to scrub that
3:20
out and opening the pores because i use
