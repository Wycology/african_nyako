hey guys welcome back to my youtube
2:55
channel
2:56
in case you're new please subscribe hit
2:58
the like button and press the
3:00
notification bell so today we are going
3:03
to be
3:04
harvesting sweet potatoes
3:07
and this is the garden so this is sweet
3:09
potato it's a root tuber
3:12
so the sweet potato is down like anna
3:15
in the sun
3:18
so these ones are still young but i'm
3:20
going to be showing you there
3:22
the other is under there but i'll be
3:24
showing you that when we are harvesting
3:26
them
3:27
so these are the leaves this how the
3:29
leaves look like
3:32
you have this type these are smaller
3:34
leaves so these ones have like
3:36
red sweet potatoes and these ones have
3:40
orange or
3:41
white
3:42
sweet potatoes so you'll be see
3:45
let's go
3:47
let's go and we start
4:20
[Music]
4:25
so in the village
4:27
see how many children
4:29
you're supposed to
4:30
approve
4:34
some foreign
4:52
because
4:53
if you dig
5:29
candy
5:50
hey
5:52
so these are the sweet potatoes we have
5:54
got
5:55
this one the red
5:57
outside
5:58
and
6:00
white inside let me show you
6:03
see
6:11
so after we are going to boil them this
6:13
is how you peel as we put it i'm using
6:14
that panga so that's why it's hard to
6:17
peel
6:18
so when you peel them like this
6:21
you boil them you can have them for
6:23
breakfast have them for lunch or dinner
6:26
with sauce so
6:28
these are one of our step of food that
6:30
we eat here
6:32
almost daily which are not mistaken but
6:36
we have them daily either for breakfast
6:39
or lunch
6:41
yeah so let me continue
6:44
then i'll see you guys because we need
6:46

6:47
this one well i'll show you when you're

7:39
so first we had to continue
7:42
to continue
7:44
