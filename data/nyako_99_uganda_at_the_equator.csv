0:03
you have no shadow
0:05
you can't see your shirt at least
0:07
sure that's when the sun is
0:13
just happening
0:14
much
0:29
then your body weight also
0:31
at the equator three percent less
0:34
welcome
0:39
but then
0:41
after pouring
0:42
stabilize the water fast
0:45
i'm trying to stabilize sounds
0:53
have you ever wondered
0:55
if
0:56
water
0:57
really
0:58
goes down the plug
1:00
the other way
1:02
on
1:03
the other side of the equator
1:06
join me through this experiment
1:08
you'll get to know
1:24
these are my names
1:25
and i'm going to show you what we call
1:27
geographical
1:28
boat experiment
1:30
because now we're in the north
1:31
for cold water we're going to sit
1:33
streaming low point
1:35
but then
1:37
after pouring total stabilize the water
1:40
fast
1:41
i'm trying to stabilize the food
1:44
then after stabilizing the water
2:16
at the equator
2:34
you have
2:47
is
3:00
your body weight also
3:02
at the equator
3:13
[Music]
3:20
[Music]
3:24
then
3:25
this line where
3:39
hello
3:59
is pulling the south is pulling you
4:01
can't even get the certificate from the
4:02
students you can read the family names
4:04
the date you've been here and the time
4:08
on the ganache rotating of the world
4:26
is
4:33
three facts about the equator
4:36
the name equator
4:38
is the latin language for
4:41
event mecca so literally it means event
4:43
maker
4:45
at the equator the day and the night are
4:48
exactly the same
4:50
like they are the same length throughout
4:52
the year
4:54
the equator is halfway between the north
4:57
pole and the south pole
5:00
did you know that your weight is less
5:03
on the equator than at the north or
5:06
south pole but the difference is small
5:10
note that your body itself does not
5:13
change
5:14
rather it is the force of gravity and
5:16
other forces that changes as you
5:19
approach the poles
5:21
and the forces changes right back when
5:24
you return to your original latitude
5:27
wow that's so wonderful
5:29
at the center of the earth
5:32
gravity is zero because all the mass
5:35
around you is pulling up
5:39
wow
5:44
north is pulling the south is pulling
5:46
you can't even get the certificate for
5:47
the students you can read the family
5:49
names the data being here
5:58
you have no shadow
6:00
you can't see your shadow
6:02
sure that's when
6:24
your body weight also
6:26
at the equator three percent less
6:28
welcome
6:30
very clean
