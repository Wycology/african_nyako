his location and the city room
3:13
because here we don't have a dining
3:15
only eat from outside here only if these
3:18
are dining
3:28
so guys as you can see the houses anyway
3:30
let's first focus on this street this
3:32
street is uh i don't know how they call
3:34
it but it's a yeah it's a back tree it's
3:36
called the back tree but it has a palm
3:39
tree in the middle it's not crafted but
3:42
that's how it grew
3:44
as you can see from there anyway so
3:47
those houses that you can sing
3:50
there are so many but we live in
3:52
extended families whereby your
3:54
grandmother your grandfather your father
3:57
your mother your uncles your brothers
4:00
everyone
4:02
in the same house so enjoy the video
4:09
[Music]
4:11
so this is
4:42
[Music]
4:44
[Laughter]
5:09
so this is the living room or the big
5:11
room the big house as you can see it's
5:14
big
5:28
this is the living room as you can see
5:30
it's decorated
5:31
with jesus
5:33
saint michael
5:34
pop francis for entertainment
5:42
[Music]
5:48

5:55
yeah every time you want to drink you
5:57
just come and
5:58

6:00
um
6:04
[Music]
6:10
the homestead
6:13
here we go to the latrine it's a very
6:16
tiny latrine as you can see
6:25
so let's go
6:38
[Applause]
6:42
so this is the latrine it's really small
6:46
but it's enough
6:51
this is how you enter and you do your
6:53
business is there that i don't want to
6:55
enter because i don't
6:57
i don't have sanders
7:02
[Music]
7:07
did you see the other old lady that's
7:09
the grandmother of the home so these are
7:11
his kids houses
7:13
as you can see so every
7:17
child has a house here if you're above
7:20
15 you build your own hat
7:22
so as you can see they have a very big
7:24
compound
7:26
so this is a typical village homestead
7:29
here we live in
7:31
extended family as you can see so we
7:33
have a lot of houses in one compound
7:37
you know when you visit someone in my
7:39
village they prepare for you food so we
7:42
went at around 5 00 pm but still they
7:45
had to give us lunch
7:46
so
7:47
there we go that brought our lunch so
7:50
we're going to have the lunch but you
7:52
have to first pray for the food
7:55
wash your hands well
7:57
and then you pray and eat your food
8:00
please enjoy the video
8:02
and let me know if when you visit your
8:05
people also all your all your relatives
8:07
in your villages if they
8:09
serve you food or tea anything please
8:13
let me know in the comments if you guys
8:15
also do it the same way we do it
8:26
um
8:28
[Applause]
8:34
[Applause]
8:41
um
9:05
yes
9:10
[Laughter]
9:15
[Music]
9:18
all right
9:30
come on
10:00
[Music]
10:01
so this is how they plant sweet potatoes
10:04
you get this these are leaves or stems
10:06
and then
10:07
and then
10:09
mine
10:10
and then you put it in the soil you see
10:14
here like that
10:25
so my auntie can do it better than me
10:28
that's why she's she's showing you
10:30
people
10:32
[Music]
10:42
so for the sweet potatoes you have to
10:44
first plow the land when you plow the
10:47
land
10:48
as you can see in front of us they dug
10:50
it
10:51
and then you start gathering the soil
10:53
together making the hips of soil but in
10:56
a line as you can see behind them it's a
10:59
line
11:00
so you be gathering the hips of the soy
11:03
in a line
11:05
and then
11:06
when you do that that's when you start
11:08
putting the leaves as you can see behind
11:11
if you see critically behind them those
11:13
hips of land of soil have been put in
11:18
uh no
11:19
those heaps of
11:20
soil they've put in the
11:23
sweet potato leaves so basically
11:27
that's it like that's how you plant
11:30
the sweet potatoes and in three months
11:33
they'll be ready to be eaten
11:37
[Music]
11:46
so as you can see that's the garden
11:48
that's the overview of the garden the
11:51
other ones were planted yesterday and
11:53
today that's what we are doing those are
11:56
the potatoes sweet potato leaves so they
11:59
always gather
12:01
soy like this
12:02
and then you get this and put it inside
12:07
put it
12:08
inside like that
12:12
this is the way they propagate it can
12:15
you need to get that angle
12:22
so you have to follow the way it's
12:23
growing if it's going upwards that's you
12:25
put that down apart
12:27
inside
12:29
like that
12:34
i think i need to add one here
12:40
that's how they do
13:16
so in three months from now they'll be
13:18
ready hopefully
13:20
i'll be here in december to show you
13:22
guys
13:24
yeah if you're still on my channel you
13:26
will not miss this so i'm going now
