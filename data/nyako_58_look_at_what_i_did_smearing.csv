1:01
smear this house like the floor
1:03
as you can see the first things first if
1:06
you want to smear the house you have to
1:08
first sweep it so we are going to swim
1:24
so you sweep
1:30
after sweeping then you get some water
1:34
and you sprinkle
1:50
so after that
1:52
get water like this and you sprinkle
2:00
so that it can be able to
2:03
stick on the ground
2:19
oh
2:37
is a village you don't have a house help
2:39
you be doing this at the same time
2:41
cooking your breakfast so this is our
2:42
breakfast
2:59
okay
3:06
[Music]
3:29
yeah so let's continue
3:45
so this is the
3:47
black soil
3:48
and jet come material
3:51
and um
3:52
alka correspond
3:54
so this is how you mix it
3:56
after mixing it
3:59
then you can start
4:02
smearing the flow
4:05
like this
4:08
then if you guys are seeing
4:26
be lazy
4:40
uh
4:42
[Music]
4:43
guys as i told you have to be
4:46
preparing breakfast
4:48
at the same time so there is a lot of
4:50
smoke here
4:51
but never mind
4:54
let me add these are firewood so let me
4:56
add
4:58
some yeah
5:20
it's lighting
5:26
[Music]
5:37
it
5:37
but this one still
5:40
we have to wait for it to
5:42
first
5:44
dry a bit
5:46
so let's continue so you can see the
5:48
difference between that side and this
5:50
side
5:52
with my back
5:53
that side i've already smeared it well
5:57
with the soil
5:58
and then this side is not yet smeared so
6:01
you can see let's continue
6:29
i'm
6:44
foreign
7:08
so
7:09
as a moment you have to keep your house
7:11
clean
7:12
like this
7:15
at least you do this every after
7:17
two weeks that's two times a month
7:20
or once a month
7:22
so when you finish that get some water
7:25
put in your hands
7:28
put some water
7:39
use water
7:55
so i have to make sure it's really even
7:58
like it's
8:00
looking nice and the same
8:30
and see after doing this you have to get
8:33
a very smooth stone this is a stone it's
8:36
called lightning so when you get the
8:39
stone it smoothens the look that's what
8:42
we are going to do right now
8:49
so you put some water
8:52
and then you do like this
9:01
trust me there is a difference you guys
9:03
cannot see anyone
9:34
another
9:45
so you guys can see from here let me
9:48
just put this light here
9:50
there's a difference
9:53
between here the one that is smoothened
9:56
and there that is not yet smoothened and
9:58
then there that is not yet
10:01
um smeared so this is not yet smeared
10:04
this one is smeared
10:06
and this one is smeared and smoothened
10:09
so you guys can see
10:15
i'm going to add some water
10:20
so if you're doing this thing there's
10:22
something that you should not mind about
10:25
should not mind about your hands being
10:27
soft
10:28
do not mind about your knees as you can
10:30
see my knee because i have to kneel down
10:33
like this
10:35
and my hands i have to be touching this
10:37
but then i don't really care i don't
10:39
mind
10:40
i'm okay with it
10:42
this is the way of life
10:44
so we don't care
10:47
is that okay
10:52
yeah so let me continue and i finish
10:55
here
10:56
and then i will show you guys when we
10:58
