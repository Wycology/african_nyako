0:04
this is where they sleep sometimes they
0:07
pee on the bed sometimes they don't
0:11
but they don't really care
0:14
because they're comfortable
0:16
but one time i'll buy for them a
0:18
mattress
0:19
i don't mess with it yeah if it's um
0:23

0:30
so today i'm going to show you guys
0:33
the evening routine for the twins
0:36
because someone requested and you know
0:38
your request is my command so today i'll
0:40
be showing you briefly
0:42
how they get ready to go to bed
0:45
it's obviously not night but i decided
0:49
to do it at this time because at night
0:51
we don't have light so i cannot shoot a
0:53
video at night
0:54
hopefully you enjoy this video and gives
0:57
me a give me a thumbs up so that
1:00
the video can saturate
1:02
anyway without further ado let's dive
1:05
into the video
1:07
and don't forget to leave me a comment
1:09
in case of anything
1:11
if you want any video to be specific
1:13
tell me in the comment section below
1:15
let's go into the video where i sleep
1:19
so every evening this is basically going
1:21
to be our evening routine i always
1:24
shower them
1:25
but then i'm not going to shower them
1:26
because of my youtube refrigerations
1:31
so i'm just going to show you what we do
1:34
basically so this is the bath soap
1:38
so for someone who wanted me to make a
1:41
video and washing my hands with soap
1:43
this is it
1:51
so that is it i think this can do for
1:54
you
1:56
yeah
1:57
so we cover them with this
1:59
oh we made them with it
2:02
this is what i always
2:18
hello
2:22
so i have to clean them
2:26
they are nuts
2:28
it's like they have flu both of them
2:31
i think when i'm going to take them to
2:32
the hospital
2:34
because
2:35
so this is what we use like a towel
2:38
and we clean them
2:40
until i looked in they're locked in
2:43
so i have to make sure
2:53
okay
3:12
so guys so we really
3:14
shower them
3:16
like for real
3:18
and then we dry up them with this
3:40
foreign
3:56
foreign
4:06
so
4:07
we shower them like that like the whole
4:10
body
4:11
from here
4:12
and we drank looks like
4:14
after it's falling down but we don't
4:16
really care
4:17
actually our soil is sandy so it doesn't
4:20
work
4:25
anyway so this is how i'm showing you
4:28
but we always don't do it like it's okay
4:31
like this but when they are naked and we
4:33
shower them
4:35
what
4:36
what
4:37
they are saying yes
4:51
okay so we are clean
4:55
then
4:57
after
4:58
aries
4:59
kept this water to wash my feet
5:02
before i go to shower because mary tower
5:04
at night outside like behind the house
5:08
there
5:16
[Applause]
5:21
okay
5:26
[Applause]
5:36
you can see
5:41
so while they wait
5:48
so they always drink their tea while
6:03
papyrus mat
6:05
so
6:06
in the morning we bring it outside and
6:08
put it here or sometimes you use it you
6:11
guys saw me i used it when i was
6:12
pounding out the brown nuts here this is
6:15
the one you sit on it during the day and
6:17
at night it's there out it's their base
6:20
it's their sleeping mat so to make sure
6:24
that nothing is there
6:28
like this
6:29
make sure there's nothing
6:31
like insects or
6:46
bring it inside
6:53
[Applause]
7:01
six
7:03
so you put it like this
7:05
[Music]
7:06
and then this is where their mother
7:08
sleep
7:10
i don't want to show you that because of
7:12
her pregnancy but her mother sleeps
7:14
inside here
7:16
and that this is like how i drop where
7:18
they keep their clothes
7:21
and they say i'm going to get there
7:26
see this is the one they use
7:28
the
7:56
every day
7:58
at night
8:13
so i'm trying to convince them so they
8:15
can show you guys how they sleep
8:19
and then sometimes when i spend a night
8:22
here with them if their mother is not
8:24
around
8:25
this is how we sleep
8:29
but me always get like extra clothes and
8:32

8:36
extra clothes and put
8:38
my hands and then
8:41
with lip
8:43
we need to come
8:46
here
8:50

8:52
they pee on the bed sometimes they don't
8:56
but they don't really care
8:59
because they are comfortable
9:01
but one time i'll buy for them a
9:03
