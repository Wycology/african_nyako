2:04
me how do you think i look
2:05
i look cute i know so you don't need to
2:07
tell me anyway
2:09
so um what businesses can you start to
2:12
enter
2:13
not to me why do i keep on saying 20
2:16
million like
2:17
don't even have that money so it's 2
2:20
million you can actually mentionings
2:21
like
2:23
so i have a list of businesses but i'm
2:26
going to
2:26
try and tell you how you can do that
2:30
so the first business we are going to do
2:34
about take like a small bottle yeah not
2:37
like
2:38
a small boutique not like a clothing
2:40
line where you have to
2:42
import things from europe from china
2:45
from one no
2:46
you can start with that two million and
2:49
you start
2:50
up your own body can you be your own
2:52
boss playing with too
2:54
much how so according to my research
2:58
boutiques perform well in uganda in
3:01
uganda
3:02
and the whole of east africa with two
3:04
million ugandan shillings to invest
3:07
starting up a small boutique is the most
3:10
brave
3:11
business move you can ever take
3:14
you can never take custody like you can
3:18
take that
3:19
so to maximize the profit you can get
3:21
from the boutique
3:22
you need to put it on
3:26
to the one of the busiest
3:29
streets like him to locate
3:32
a bus a business street like look for a
3:35
busy place
3:38
just move make a research be like where
3:40
can i put
3:41
in the best idea if you have your car 2
3:44
million and you want to
3:46
invest in a boutique look for a place
3:49
that has like a lot of people like the
3:51
university
3:52
trading centers then
3:56
like your town but then the main street
3:59
of the town you understand
4:02
and you can start with a secondhand
4:04
clothes because they're really cheap
4:06
you can have like one million for your
4:09
stock
4:10
and the other 500 for a kiosk
4:14
or a place and then 500
4:17
000 for running the business you people
4:20
pay me for my ideas otherwise
4:23
but subscribe i don't need mine i just
4:25
need a subscription
4:27
subscribe so that i have that energy to
4:29
bring you more business ideas and what
4:31
business you can invest in in uganda
4:35
so that's like one of our business
4:39
ideas like what you can start with to
4:41
air such a boutique
4:43
start as small as you have like don't
4:46
wait to be like
4:47
i have to wait when i have this when i
4:50
have that
4:51
no time will never come start with what
4:53
you have
4:54
but then you have to estimate that
4:56
whatever you're doing has to fall
4:58
into that amount so that you don't
5:00
collapse
5:02
before even the business sets off so
5:04
basically do that
5:05
i would advise you to go for secondhand
5:08
clothes because they are cheaper
5:11
yeah and um another thing
5:14
if you're doing that business don't buy
5:16
a clothes attack one dollar and sell it
5:18
at five dollars seriously
5:21
buy it at one sell it at point five
5:24
so like buy it at three thousand sell it
5:26
at five k
5:27
that two thousand is enough but if you
5:30
want a lot of profit to end up
5:33
anyway so another business that's the
5:36
english one
5:37
cosmetic shop cosmetic shop
5:40
so when you get that money you can start
5:43
buying like
5:44
beauty products in town
5:48
like in downtown yeah
5:52
and you get your small place
5:55
but then for that i would advise you to
5:58
do it online
5:59
because you don't have to get a physical
6:01
shield with that you can
6:02
basically brand your products well and
6:06
sell online use facebook use your
6:08
whatsapp use your
6:09
instagram like sell go and comment on
6:13
these people's
6:14
like the celebrities pages
6:18
comment that people will buy use
6:21
them online shops that
6:24
gg whatever you just go and put your
6:27
products at the book and buy them
6:29
and you will thank me later so that's
6:31
still within our 2 million you
6:33
understand you can get those businesses
6:36
another thing this is like a very nice
6:40
idea a washing day like
6:43
a washing day or watching i don't know
6:46
whatever one of us
6:48
so are watching them you can
6:51
locate a place or the main road where i
6:54
think you can put a washing bed
6:57
and get like two boys to be working for
7:00
you
7:01
and then you can accompany that like tea
7:04
or coffee
7:07
like if someone comes to wash their car
7:10
they also have somewhere to serve them
7:13
coffee and tea
7:15
at an affordable price so that two
7:17
million trust
7:18
me because you're going to rent that
7:20
place that the input is only renting
7:22
that place and then
7:23
the money that those boys work will be
7:26
the one to pay them
7:28
and even you getting the money so really
7:32
really you're sitting home are you
7:34
telling me that no businesses in uganda
7:37
it's only me there are no businesses in
7:38
uganda
7:40
so you can start empowering yeah
7:44
easy and simple just look at our place
7:46
go and talk to the owner of the plot
7:48
tell them i have this idea but then some
7:50
people can be like cheeky
7:51
when you start your business and they be
7:53
like oh i also wanted to do
7:55
that they make you but then make sure
7:57
you have a written contract
8:01
make the things to be legit like legally
8:05
if they give you permission to work
8:06
there i agree with how much you have to
8:09
pay them per month
8:10
then make it make like the duration
8:14
in the country like i'm going to be here
8:16
for five years
8:18
so within that period you don't have to
8:20
tell me any nonsense that i have to
8:22
leave your place because my business is
8:24
doing well or
8:25
your grandmother has fallen down anyway
8:28
so make sure it's under
8:32
our contracts so they don't disturb you
8:34
when your business
8:35
is booming
8:38
okay another thing is poetry farming
8:42
poetry family yeah i know you've heard
8:44
many people telling you
8:45
oh portray the chicken will die
8:48
or the cosmeosis
8:52
media make a market research
8:55
plan well it will work for you like
8:59
look at me it will work for you i'm not
9:02
a motivational speaker but
9:03
when you set up your mind everything can
9:05
work
9:06
so basically you can do that you can get
9:10
so this work best when you have a place
9:13
already
9:14
let me set your home or your parents
9:15
home you can set up a fan
9:18
or buy the lightings and the face but
9:22
then the
9:23
chicks are really very cheap they're
9:25
like they're not expensive but so you
9:27
can buy even a hundred of them
9:29
and you get double profits so that is it
9:32
another
9:33
thing and the last business that you can
9:37
do how many minutes here okay
9:40
this is okay i want this video to be as
9:43
short as possible so i don't want to
9:45
know why you guys
9:46
so the last one is pig farming
9:50
did you know how much i think can cost
9:53
here
9:55
people can eat things
10:00
so it's if you make something else there
10:04
you can do that business it's really
10:07
like how do you do it
10:10
it's like nice you can
10:14
get a pig at 50 000
10:26
you get like two pairs at 200 thousand
10:30
just using time feed them you know how
10:33
much you sell that
10:35
you know how much you sell like 1
10:38
million
10:39
imagine imagine making 1 million from
10:42
only 200 000
10:45
imagine imagine
10:48
because you're going to sell one at 500
10:51
000 i'm like
10:53
like i'm a sure pig
10:56
the other one also and then if they
10:59
deliver babies
11:00
produce babies the piglets every pair
11:03
you still sell they can produce like ten
11:07
eight and you're going to sell a pair at
11:10
a time
11:11
to a 200 000 at one hundred thousand
11:14
and those are just piglets so if you can
11:17
just be like oh and i'll be selling only
11:19
piglets still you're working
11:22
you'll get money
11:26
so those were my business ideas i just
11:29
had to come and check in quick quick and
11:31
i tell you so that you don't be there
11:34
