0:52

0:54
to the spirit stage so please stay in to
0:57

1:00
and press the notification bell so that
1:02
you don't miss out so we are here
1:04
where they make it from
1:06
at someone's home and i can see someone
1:09
ready
1:10
to take the alcohol so i think we can go
1:13
and ask her a little bit to get some
1:15
interviews from her something about her
1:30
[Music]
1:38
then i come take her
1:40
i don't find anyone i'm the one who is
1:42
here so i can manipulate so you are the
1:44
first person
1:46
i am the first person to come here
1:48
please
1:49
we are going to give you but where are
1:51
these people they are going to come you
1:53
can cook quickly okay i'm going to cook
1:57
for you don't worry
2:04
so this one is like it's the mixture
2:08
so at first you first get cassava
2:11
and then you ferment it when you ferment
2:13
the cassava
2:14
this is what you get after days
2:17
and then
2:18
you have this i don't know how it's
2:20
called
2:21
and then you pour to ferment it i think
2:23
that's the one or to distill it yeah
2:26
to distill it
2:28
so here we go
2:32
and this is where we are going to cook
2:34
it for it to distill and evaporate into
2:37
the spirit
2:41
so after
2:43
you put it here
2:59
so this is the soil that we are going to
3:01
use to block the airways
3:04
so it has to be really
3:06
smooth
3:07
and intact
3:12
and the timer i know you were you
3:16
so i have to make it back by the way you
3:18
break it
3:20
like that
3:21
for some time
3:30
so i have to light the fire because it
3:32
wasn't lit though she was already
3:35
cooking but then it rained and then she
3:37
had to stop so i have to restart the
3:39
process for her
3:41
yeah let me light the fire and then
3:43
continue telling you guys whatever it
3:45
takes to make a loco bro
3:51
that thing that can it's um it's
3:54
metallic i don't think it's metallic
3:56
it's iron
3:57
so that's why they used to heat that
4:00
um mixture
4:02
that is made from cassava flour
4:07
so when you heat it i'm going to be
4:09
setting up the setup so that you guys
4:12
can see the process is called
4:14
distillation hope you guys know that
4:17
yeah so you're going to be seeing
4:19
whatever it takes
4:28
so this is our stage two this is what
4:30
you do this one
4:38
put it
4:43
yeah this is a local pot and then this
4:45
is a pipe
4:47
this is a pipe
4:48
it's made of iron
4:51
and this is a normal pot
4:54
and then i think this is where we are
4:56
going to be distilling from
4:58
yeah
5:18
so after
5:20
you get your soil
5:23
and put it around so that you can block
5:26
all the airwaves
5:43
so you have to make sure that there is
5:45
no any
5:47
corner or space that lets in air because
5:50
you want that thing to evaporate and
5:52
pass through that
5:54
pipe
5:55
so basically you have to make sure that
5:57
you
5:59
build the mud around it carefully
6:10
[Music]
6:18
so after you get some water and you
6:20
smear around it just to make sure that
6:22
all the holes are
6:24
covered and it's all intact
6:27
yes that's where i put some
6:29
that
6:30
water
6:37
so this setup can show that this is a
6:40
distillation method
6:42
so you put here
6:44
the mixture
6:46
that was fermented
6:48
and then heat it when you heat it to
6:51
evaporate and go through this
6:54
funnel
6:56
which is metallic or iron
6:59
and then here you have to put something
7:01
that will be collecting the spirit
7:05
the alcohol
7:09
so there is this small
7:11
thread that is used to capture them so
7:14
they don't just pour outside but they
7:16
pour direct in the
7:19
jericho
7:21
yeah so let's continue
7:24
you see the fire is now lit so it's
7:27
heating our
7:28
mixture
7:46
so you can only add water in that pot
7:49
the middle pot when the
7:51
can starts heating up that's when you
7:54
add water to cool up the vapor
7:56
that will later turn into liquor
7:59
so i'm heating up then
8:01
i can pour water
8:04
in the pot the water should be cold
8:08
so it will help to condense
8:12
is it condensing the process of liquid
8:15
vapor into liquid however noise can tell
8:18
me
8:19
yeah quantization i think
8:21
so it will condense and then become into
8:24
liquid
8:26
yeah
8:27
so that's what i just did i poured water
8:29
in
8:30
the pot that will help to cool up that
8:33
pipe
8:35
by the way that pipe goes through that
8:37
pot
8:38
to the little jelly to the lyric jericho
8:46
the water might not look that clean but
8:49
anyway it doesn't affect the outcome of
8:51
our spirit and then you have to use
8:54
something to be cooling the water like
8:57
remove the
8:58
heat that is inside so i decided to use
9:01
that boiling when it's burning from here
9:03
it evaporates through this
9:06
and then here you have to make
9:08
this one condenses the thing
9:12
the evaporated thing so this is how you
9:14
keep it cool
9:16
and then
9:21
and now this is the liquor here
9:23
you guys can see sure
9:30
i don't know if you guys can see but the
9:32
alcohol is there
9:39
so you can see it there
9:42
so that's the alcohol
9:56
yes guys finally i did it now you can
9:58
see i've produced liquor
10:00
um remember we still have our customers
10:02
they are waiting
10:04
so i cannot give them the hot one i have
10:07
to go and get the one inside that they
10:09
prepared earlier
10:11
and then serve to the customers and then
10:14
i'll wait to see what they're telling us
10:18
am i good at this or not
10:21
anyway you have to make sure that you
10:23
keep the fire lighting it had red so
10:26
that fire is really giving me hard time
10:29
but i'm trying
10:31
to blow in
10:32
air every time every time now and then
10:35
to keep it lighting
10:56
that they have already made
11:02
but it has a very nice scent
11:05
so we are going to give our customers
11:07
i've already come
11:09
let's go and give them
11:11
and we get some money money so let me be
11:15
shaking on this one
11:26
make sure everything is fine make sure
11:29
that that water keeps cool
11:32
that's why i did that
11:33
[Music]
11:34
and make sure the fire is lighting
11:38
and then
11:40
serve your customers
11:42
so guys i just used my little brother to
11:44
take my video or my sister but then they
11:46
